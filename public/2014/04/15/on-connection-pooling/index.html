<p>Connection pooling is quickly becoming one of the more frequent questions I hear. So here&rsquo;s some words on it:</p>

<h3>The basics</h3>

<p>For those unfamiliar, a connection pool is a group of database connections sitting around that are waiting to be handed out and used. This means when a request comes in a connection is already there whether in your framework or some other pooling process, and then given to your application for that specific request or transaction.  In contrast, without any connection pooling your application will have to reach out to your database to establish a connection. While in the most basic sense you may thinking connecting to a database is quick, often theres some overhead here. An example is SSL negotiation that may have to occur which means you&rsquo;re looking at not 1-2 ms but often closer to 30-50.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s really two major options when it comes to connection pooling:</p>

<h4>Framework pooling</h4>

<p>Today many modern application frameworks have at least some basic level of connection pooling. This means as your application server starts up it will create a pool of connections to use.</p>
