	<div class="entry-content"><div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">I&#8217;ve thought for some considerable time now about Twitter and how I feel it actually has more value than facebook with regards to advertising. The difference is context. However, I want to take a moment to look at it from a different angle. There is another key factor that drives the value of the network and the way you can monetize it, The authenticity of the network.</div>


<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Facebook is as authentic of a network as you can have, you have you, you are you, you&#8217;re not FunChick21, or MotorcycleGuy42, You&#8217;re Craig Kerstiens. You have a birthdate, which is likely you&#8217;re birthdate, you have a job that is your job, you have friends that are you&#8217;re friends. Facebook is probably as close to a virtual representation of your true life as you can get on a social network.</div>


<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Then you have Twitter. Twitter is probably as inauthentic as they come. You ARE FunChick21 or MotorcycleGuy42. You have that name, and that&#8217;s it. You have friends, but they&#8217;re up to you, it&#8217;s a one way relationship, not confirmation of friendship. For that reason you have 1,000,000 people following Ashton Kutcher, and he follows under 100. You&#8217;re friends could be celebrities, they could be friends, they could be random people that you liked their tweets.</div>


<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Facebook from an ad perspective I know almost everything I could want to about you from an ad targeting perspective. Few sites could give much more demographic info that I&#8217;d want to target effectively. Twitter I have next to nothing, I have a user name, and the content of what you say.</div>


<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">So there&#8217;s an advantage to facebook. But then you have the context of what I&#8217;m trying to do. If you&#8217;re facebook, you have users engaged in the site not wanting to leave. If you&#8217;re Twitter you have users that won&#8217;t be on the site for beyond 60 seconds. Getting them to leave shouldn&#8217;t be an issue, which means if you can drive where they are leaving to it should work out well for you.</div>


<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">But there&#8217;s a final piece. It&#8217;s a heavily growing marketplace, that really neither of the major communities picks up on, and it&#8217;s virtual goods. Virtual goods exist in either form of network, but neither seems to take advantage, meanwhile it&#8217;s the entire basis behinds such communities as World of Warcraft. How will they start to roll into mainstream networks, that&#8217;s yet to be seen, but I&#8217;ll be curious if virtual goods can become dominant in authentic networks or if they&#8217;ll primarily reside in inauthentic networks as they do today.</div>


<p>I&rsquo;ve thought for some considerable time now about Twitter and how I feel it actually has more value than facebook with regards to advertising. The difference is context. However, I want to take a moment to look at it from a different angle. There is another key factor that drives the value of the network and the way you can monetize it, The authenticity of the network.</p>

<p>Facebook is as authentic of a network as you can have, you have you, you are you, you&rsquo;re not FunChick21, or MotorcycleGuy42, You&rsquo;re Craig Kerstiens. You have a birthdate, which is likely you&rsquo;re birthdate, you have a job that is your job, you have friends that are you&rsquo;re friends. Facebook is probably as close to a virtual representation of your true life as you can get on a social network.</p>

<p>Then you have Twitter. Twitter is probably as inauthentic as they come. You ARE FunChick21 or MotorcycleGuy42. You have that name, and that&rsquo;s it. You have friends, but they&rsquo;re up to you, it&rsquo;s a one way relationship, not confirmation of friendship. For that reason you have 1,000,000 people following Ashton Kutcher, and he follows under 100. You&rsquo;re friends could be celebrities, they could be friends, they could be random people that you liked their tweets.</p>

<p>Facebook from an ad perspective I know almost everything I could want to about you from an ad targeting perspective. Few sites could give much more demographic info that I&rsquo;d want to target effectively. Twitter I have next to nothing, I have a user name, and the content of what you say.</p>

<p>So there&rsquo;s an advantage to facebook. But then you have the context of what I&rsquo;m trying to do. If you&rsquo;re facebook, you have users engaged in the site not wanting to leave. If you&rsquo;re Twitter you have users that won&rsquo;t be on the site for beyond 60 seconds.
