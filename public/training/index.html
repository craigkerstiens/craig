<p>
At least once a week I receive an email from someone to the effect of &#8220;We&#8217;re running Postgres and we&#8217;re growing, we&#8217;ve started hitting bottlenecks and performance issues and we&#8217;re hoping you can point us in the right direction.&#8221; I&#8217;ve responded to many of these emails, done training seminars on how to diagnose your database performance as an application developer, and spoken at conferences around this. I&#8217;ve now compiled all of this knowledge to help you go from feeling like your database is a black box to getting a feel for overall health, to where to dig in and find quick wins when it comes to performance improvements. 
</p>


<p>
This has been compiled into a series of write-ups which are now available for you to purchase via email. These write-ups are delivered 1 per week to allow you time to dig into each and apply what you knowâ€“optimizing along the way. In addition to the content itself you&#8217;ll have the ability to reach out and follow-up directly for further instruction via email.
