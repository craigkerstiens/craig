			Large Corporations Versus Startups</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>After a year of living in Silicon Valley it&rsquo;s hard not to be consumed with the excitement around one startup after the next. The hopes of being the next eBay, Google, or Facebook lie within many of individuals in the area. Some pursue it, some write it off as a distant hope, and still others just want to be a part of them at some point.</p>

<p>But why would someone just want to be a part of Google 5 years ago? The first thing that comes to mind is money, and while thats nice, I don&rsquo;t believe its at the root of it. There&rsquo;s a vastly different atmosphere at a startup. For one you have a say, right now if I left my company, I&rsquo;d get good-byes from 100 people, be missed by maybe 20, and the other 159,900 would move along as if nothing happened. But if I left a startup the entire company notices, so there is a closer sense of belonging. Still I don&rsquo;t believe this is the heart of it.</p>

<p>In part if you have the ability to make it at a startup you&rsquo;re of a different breed. If a startup excites you, you&rsquo;re of a different breed. You eat, sleep, breath what you do. In a 160,000 person company I don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s any way 100% of the employees decided it was a dream job, or as a 10 year old, or even at 16 it was what they wanted to do with their life. But the kid that was developing at 12 his own first person shooter game, or at 16 was following the markets and getting a summer job to be able to invest, those are of a different breed. For those, it&rsquo;s not a job, its a portion of who they are. You don&rsquo;t do home and unwind, you go home and read more blogs, dive further into your area of expertise, and work on your own projects that allow you to bring more expertise into the workplace.</p>

<p>Perhaps this same attitude and drive applies in other industries, though I have the greatest insight into tech/web companies. There was a statement made by Paul Graham of Y Combinator at startup school recently. He said that investors are looking for the type of individuals that don&rsquo;t need them, the type that are going to make it regardless of what everyone else says and who supports them. This is succinctly different than the corporate world, where you have to have validation all across the board to be able to move forward.</p>

<p>As I write this and contemplate more I believe it becomes even more of a chicken and egg problem. Startups require a certain type of individual, but those individuals are the ones best suited for startups.</p>

			Twitter Will Be Commonplace in the Enterprise</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Twitter is great for a few key reasons, first let me highlight the two <strong>key</strong> uses I feel it has in the enterprise.</p>

<ol>
    <li>As an asynchronous instant message or status message. Companies are constantly reporting status back and forth. But when someone asks for status I don&#8217;t always have bandwidth to give it, then when I&#8217;m available to give it, not everyone is free to hear. Instead why not cut down the meeting times and I simply publish messages only to those that its directed at, then they consume when they&#8217;re ready to. Additionally a twitter-like ability would be easier to control. This would allow twitter to be present where IM is still currently banned in some organizations. Yes, it may be hard to believe, but some companies still don&#8217;t trust their employees to use IM as an effective communication tool.</li>
    <li>Ideation! When I have a fraction of a thought I don&#8217;t know what to do with it. When I have a complete, full-fledged out thought, I have a blog post about it. However if I&#8217;m thinking about how I don&#8217;t like the shape of a soda can or how I think email should be improved I have no medium to communicate that, except ad-hoc conversations. With twitter I say that email should be improved, but I&#8217;m not sure how. Then tens to hundreds of users give their input on why they feel its broken, and my thoughts start to become more solid. By simply limited users to 140 characters it changes the psychology around my posts, and allows content to be created on twitter, verses simply published such as on blogs</li>
</ol>


<p>So with those key uses, what about adoption. So what if it has these great uses, if no one really buys in. Well while what I&rsquo;m suggesting is twitter-<strong>like </strong>functionality, which could really be delivered by a lot of providers or a custom solution. I&rsquo;d like to examine the growth curve of email and IM within the workplace, but will do that in a later post. The keys to twitter are the character limit, the one to many conversation as a default (with options for direct public messages, and direct private messages), and finally open access. I can read and publish to twitter from my phone, IM, the web, the desktop, or other sources. This only simplifies the number of sites I have to go to, and well my life.</p>

			Adobe AIR Is a Game Changer, if People Would Build for It&#8230;</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Spend five minutes talking to me about technology or business and you&rsquo;ll quickly realize I&rsquo;m a fan of Adobe AIR. Adobe has done a very good job building a cross-platform runtime, and providing tools that make the transition from the web to the desktop quite minimal.</p>

<p>First to elaborate why I like AIR. For one I&rsquo;m a fan of web 2.0, the sites feel cleaner, smoother, and drive new capabilities. Versus most desktop applications that are starting to feel old, and much like 1990&rsquo;s Java Applets do on the web. With Flex Builder, which is an IDE for developing for flash and/or AIR, I can develop a sweet website, but then quickly port it to the desktop while maintaining a rich web 2.0 feel.</p>

<p>Second, did I mention it&rsquo;s cross-platform? Windows, OSX, Linux, the application in AIR will look/feel/function the same. So what? This could have been done other ways right? Well here is where I start to place my bets, no one else has really done anything in this area as well as Adobe so far. Also Adobe has made their long term strategy clear, they want to truly become a cross-platform runtime. If you&rsquo;re thinking what other platforms right now, you&rsquo;re not thinking large enough. They want AIR to support mobile phones, set-top boxes, likely even gaming consoles. This means I can look at one application on multiple mediums with an either identical look, of very similar one, with minimal development efforts. This allows a developer to then focus even further on improving functionality.</p>

<p>Finally, a bit of a rant. Adobe AIR does not have a true competitor, Silverlight is a competitor to flash (not AIR), Google Gears might be the closest thing to it. But, with regard to gears taking a website and making it available offline isn&rsquo;t all AIR can do. AIR has local file access, local access to some devices, which when you&rsquo;re still within a browser you can&rsquo;t do. Oh, and one feature I personally just like is the auto-update ability of applications.</p>

<p>So&hellip;.. If it&rsquo;s so great, why haven&rsquo;t you heard of it and why aren&rsquo;t you using it? Well the single problem seems to be people building applications on it. I&rsquo;ve seen very few applications that would appeal to mainstream users. I (being an avid fan of AIR and anything web 2.0), will typically use 2 AIR applications per day. One being twhirl, which I use as my primary twitter client. The other tends to vary by needs. However this is contrasted with about 20 applications that I work in over a given day. Most AIR applications thus far are simple, one-off fun applications. Perhaps to really make some penetration there should be some of the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Financial/Stock tool that takes advantage of Adobe&#8217;s charting abilities</li>
    <li>Word Application</li>
    <li>Spreadsheet Editor</li>
    <li>Central social networking aggregator (Think one stop stop to view and update all web 2.0 networks)</li>
    <li>Email client</li>
</ul>

			Why Google May Not Exist in 8-10 Years</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>As I write this, I write only from my vague knowledge of where revenue&rsquo;s come directly from. However, I do hope to back this up in the future with more numeric backing. My title of the post may be quite strong and negative, but I feel it has reasonable ground to stand on, based on one simple principle. A corporation should stick to and focus on it&rsquo;s core business, and exhausting resources outside it&rsquo;s core business could end up costing them their business.</p>

<p>As it is, Google&rsquo;s primary revenue comes from advertising, they&rsquo;re the primary source for advertising because of their search engine. While some may say their core business is data, I disagree, as how are they making money off of data. Data simply allows them to better target their ads. With Google&rsquo;s attitude of &ldquo;Do no wrong&rdquo; they are unlikely to profit from the consolidation and sales of such data.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Google is exhausting their resources with little to show for it. Google over the past 5 years has been hiring some of the top talent within Silicon Valley. Paying good salaries for individuals that are supposed to be some of the best software engineers in the industry. I&rsquo;m not suggesting that the individuals are not sharp, but what has Google truly produced from within it&rsquo;s own walls? Google has bought many of it&rsquo;s out lier products, i.e. Google Earth, Google Spreadsheets, Picasa, and others. First if they are to go into these areas they should strictly focus on acquisitions and have a smaller developer base.</p>

<p>Though from my perspective Google should not be investing in any of the three products mentioned above. While cool and arguably good products, how does Google plan on making money from these? If they are exhausting resources and effort into these products, at the expense of improving both search and ad&rsquo;s they&rsquo;re not focusing on their core business as they should be</p>

<p>Finally, if Google is not pouring into these two areas, search and ad&rsquo;s, it only takes being beaten by one to be unseated. As soon as a company is able to do search better, or ad&rsquo;s better Google will lose the majority, if not all of their revenue. While they may be able to stay around after someone else has become a dominant player, it will only be as a very small fraction of what they currently are.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not predicting that Google <strong>will </strong>be gone in 8 years, but unless they really start to devote to their core business and quit wasting resources on un-needed areas they will have something to worry about.</p>
