			Why Qik Matters</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Live video streaming from your phone might just seem like another form of lifecasting, a video form of twitter, or even a mobile version of ustream.com or justin.tv, but it really is far more than that. A few people have taken these mobile streaming services such as Qik, Flixwagon, and Kyte and really used them to their fullest capacity. Sure you can go to an extreme like Robert Scoble, but admittedly most of his content from Qik can be pretty good.</p>

<p>The real thing about mobile video streaming is something that some people have mentioned about twitter. Twitter often breaks the news, or has more information about breaking news than anywhere else. As much as anything thing else it allows for quick live footage of events. Whether its breaking news or an impromptu interview that someone happens to come across. Those willing to embrace this new form of potential reporting, and sacrifice expensive editing and high end video equipment will come away with more interesting pieces and find a rapidly growing following of consumers that tune in.</p>

<p>Mobile video streaming is far far bigger than ustream and justin.tv. It&rsquo;s about more than showing the day to day happenings of your life whenever you want, and more about continuous access to news and happenings.</p>

			Don&#8217;t Do It Yourself</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>So traditionally I&rsquo;ve been a very do it yourself person. I wanted to be the person that didn&rsquo;t have to rely on anyone, and thus far it&rsquo;s worked pretty well. I can handle my day to day chores, as well as do my job, and most any side project of venture I take on I feel like I can accomplish pretty well. However, I recently asked my question if that was the best approach. While it&rsquo;s good to be self reliant, the people at the top seldom do everything on their own. If I take notice of where I spend my time, most of it is on tasks that produce very very little value. Meanwhile there&rsquo;s other tasks where I only have time to spend a few hours a week that produce much larger value.</p>

<p>On this point what I&rsquo;m looking into is outsourcing many of these tasks. While it will take additional time to manage that process and delegate the tasks I believe I&rsquo;m currently at a break even point where it makes sense. From there it can only go uphill and not down. I&rsquo;ll likely post again in a few weeks after I&rsquo;ve seen how this is progressed, but it seems those that are accomplishing a lot, in large part its because others do so much for them.</p>

			Fotoviewr</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In the coming weeks I&rsquo;m going to be working with a friend to help his venture in a new partnership that someone has approached him about. This partnership is rather large and I&rsquo;m not at liberty to disclose details yet, and while this is indeed great news for the site, the great news for users is the site is already fully available.</p>

<p>In short <a href="http://www.fotoviewr.com">fotoviewr</a> is one half of an online photo album, it doesn&rsquo;t store your photos for you, but allows you to take your existing photos from <a href="http://www.flickr.com">flickr</a> or <a href="http://www.smugmug.com">smugmug</a> (with other support coming soon) and instantly put them into a visually appealing gallery. To me the nicest thing about it is the variety. I&rsquo;ve used piclens before, and while I love piclens to scroll through 1000&rsquo;s of pictures quickly, that seems to be the extent to which I use it. I can&rsquo;t use piclens to show off my photo&rsquo;s to friends or family. While browsing through a standard flickr page isn&rsquo;t a bad experience, it isn&rsquo;t a good one. <a href="http://www.fotoviewr.com">Fotoviewr</a> really does seem to deliver the other piece of what is missing from online photo sites.</p>

<p>Check out a few of the sample&rsquo;s below, I&rsquo;ve taken a few of my personal pictures from the past 4th of July and put them into a few of his views that are available. All-in-all this took me a fraction of the time it took to type this post, which is how more things should be online, simple.</p>

			How Ebay Missed the Boat</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>At a conversation today we got into a discussion about how ebay can compete with amazon. Which alone is enough content for an entire post, as they really aren&rsquo;t playing the same game so not really competing. Instead I&rsquo;d like to talk about where the conversation progressed to. To me the most interesting thing about ebay isn&rsquo;t how they won the long tail, or how users are unhappy with the increasing costs placed on them. Instead its more at the level of where they really lost out.</p>

<p>You see, ebay had a devoted following back around 2000. Millions of people would visit their site, buy items, focus on their feedback rating, often spending time in the same category. While at the time most of this was indeed innovative, they stopped there. If they had only taken it a step futher and exposed the final piece of the puzzle by allowing users to interact with each other. If they had developed a network of users that could communicate with each other, that shared interests based on product categories, they could have easily been one of the largest early social networking sites out there. As facebook initially exploded as a social network for college students, and other more recent ones focusing on younger crowds, meanwhile you have linkedin to as a professional network. Ebay could have very much been the network for collectors, or anyone purchasing similar items. Not only would have this increased user engagement, it would have driven more sales.</p>

<p>Take for example if I&rsquo;m a fan of a particular brand of jeans. I may be very proud of the brand I&rsquo;ve found, but recently discovered some that were newer and more hip. Well I&rsquo;m going to be a bit more hesitant to share that with my friends I hang out with as I want to be the one that&rsquo;s hip versus everyone else having them as well. However if I have a similar community that I connect with online, I can share this information, build a repoire with them, and still maintain my step ahead of friends. It allows your users to become you product recommendation engine versus the Amazon approach of through a lot of machine learning at the problem.</p>

<p>And the most unfortunate part of it all, I&rsquo;m not sure ebay even realizes they missed the boat.</p>

			How Social Networking Advertising Should Work</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Social advertising is a very different than traditional web advertising. The thing about social media advertisers, is users aren&rsquo;t looking for a product. They&rsquo;re already engaged in some activity, and don&rsquo;t necessarily want to be drawn away from that. But that does not mean there isn&rsquo;t value in it, it&rsquo;s just a different form of value than search advertising.</p>

<p>When a user is searching from google, they are actually looking for something. They&rsquo;re often looking for products, which is why advertising in its current form works great on search. It&rsquo;s logical if a user is searching for shampoo, that proctor and gamble would want to pay to have their products show up on the right. This is vastly different from when I&rsquo;m playing a racing game on facebook, and Ford shows me a commercial for their product, they&rsquo;re not the same thing.</p>

<p>However there is still HUGE value in social advertising. Since you know so much more about a user you can target them even better, I can know, age, gender, music/movie preferenes, interests, hobbies, among many other things. Where this can help is branding, if there is a car game, and you can present a solid brand in places throughout that game I become brand loyal without realizing it. I don&rsquo;t become disengaged, but I do take notice of it. It&rsquo;s much like the branding that takes place in movies, or console games, with large negotiated contracts, however it needs to occur on a micro-level.</p>

			Microsoft vs. Apple</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I find it extremely amusing that Microsoft and Apple are in many senses the very same company, at least in their actions, yet people feel very different about the two. For the average person they aren&rsquo;t really a fan of Microsoft, and many love Apple. While I&rsquo;m not really suggesting anyone should love Microsoft, why are people such Apple fanboys. Apple makes the same bad moves as Microsoft, they control their software and limit functionality in order to drive sales in the future.</p>

<p>For example with the iPhone, by disabling video streaming they are simply leaving something to be supported for next year. There&rsquo;s now doubt that the phone is fully capable, especially with 3g, as qik is already supporting it. However they are having to jump through hoops to do it, when Apple could have simply enabled it in the SDK, and yet they didn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s unfortunate for AT&amp;T in the process as well, because as people are die hard Apple fans, they feel Apple can do no wrong. This wasn&rsquo;t quite the case in recent days, first with the launch of the iPhone 3g, there were many many bricked iPhones for that morning. Almost every complaint I saw on twitter drawed attention to AT&amp;T screwing it up. However, from a source very close to the issue, the problem was entirely on Apple&rsquo;s end, as they had tested for only a fraction of the traffic they got that day, and were not able to scale up new machines nearly fast enough.</p>

<p>Now Apple woes seem to continue as with <a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2008/07/15/apple-delays-idisk-file-sharing-mobileme-issues-continue">MobileMe</a>. For all the fan boys out there, and while I agree they make a good product, they should still be help to the same regard of anyone else that makes a product, and be complained to when they screw up. Apple has indeed done a great job with marketing and a reasonable job with products, however they keep a strong reign on applications, which is why I like the applications that are on OSX, but hate that its suchaÂ  smaller number.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying love Microsoft, or even hate Apple. But people judge them on their actions, and while they drive the boundaries, theres still no hard in calling them out when they hold back just for more revenue.</p>

			Conversation Aggregators vs. Social Network Aggegators</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I recently posted about web 2.5, and since that time have been diving into two sites that attempt to do this. The first is <a href="http://www.friendfeed.com" target="_blank">friendfeed</a>, I&rsquo;ve commented about it before. It&rsquo;s overall a great site, however the community is still growing on it, and most of my personal friends are not on there, only those that I follow and interact with in a tech or professional community. And there&rsquo;s the ability to go through and create an imaginary personality for friends, but for me that could take days, and while its still tempting I can&rsquo;t quite commit that strongly. Yeah friend feed is great, but I find myself using it more for having a conversation with whoever is there, rather than using it to follow individual people.</p>

<p>With the emergence of rooms in <a href="http://www.friendfeed.com" target="_blank">friendfeed</a> it seems they realize its more about being able to have a conversation around a similar topic than it is to track individual people.</p>

<p>However it seems that <a href="http://www.socialthing.com" target="_blank">socialthing</a>, which I recently got access to, thanks <a href="http://www.twitter.com/socialthing" target="_blank">socialthing</a> team, is a slightly better aggregator at least for my demographic. Friendfeed works well for those that use blogs, google reader, photo albums and the like. But friendfeed is seriously lacking on the facebook front, meanwhile socialthing is accomplishing this very well. While I&rsquo;m not sure which one I&rsquo;ll be engaged more in, in the coming weeks though I imagine it will depend on the purpose.</p>

<p>Friendfeed works for following information about tech, news, or similar broad topics. Socialthing works for keeping up with friends, when they&rsquo;ve uploaded pictures from last friday night, or when that girl you have a crush on in high school breaks up with a long-term boyfriend and needs a rebound, and the like. I&rsquo;m not sure how friendfeed would work if they did just enable the same time of features for facebook, I imagine it might not catch as right now its about conversations more than it is a singular feed. Socialthing has a chance to win this one, but you really need to have more than 10 services you connect to.</p>

			The Problem With Facebook&#8217;s Platform, Is the Problem Isn&#8217;t the Platform</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Facebook&rsquo;s development platform just over a year ago seemed like a genius idea, with an almost infinite amount of potential. While it&rsquo;s still a very hot topic, and most sites these days when they lauch attempt to have a facebook version of their site or service available at almost at the same time. However, I believe we are already over the peak of this, as more controls are being put in place to slow viral growth, and users are spending less time on the site and engaged in the applications.</p>

<p>My problem though is not with the slowing rate of engagement in applications developed on the facebook platform, but rather on what are the primary applications. Facebook seems to have done a very good job of keeping users to stay within the confines of the site, rather than simply using it as a utility. For most facebook is their personal planner for events, their personal datebook for friends/contacts, their online photo album, their email/messaging system, and more for some. And while it&rsquo;s fine and dandy for some of these things, facebook is not the best endpoint to interact with when getting things to and from facebook.</p>

<p>Take for example the facebook chat. This is a great utility to be able to talk with friends that I may not have spoken with in years, my AIM list has around 200 users, meanwhile my facebook has over 500. No I do not wish to speak to all of these all the time, but in the rare occasion that I do it&rsquo;s convenient. However IM chat within a browser just doesn&rsquo;t do it for me, not on facebook, or meebo for that matter. The nice fact is that there is a solution and more being developed. Personally if I&rsquo;m at home I use adium (Mac only) for my instant messaging which supports facebook. If I&rsquo;m on a windows machine I use digsby to chat with my facebook friends and monitor what friends are doing. While digsby isn&rsquo;t a perfect solution, I strongly prefer it to the other option of chatting within the browser.</p>

<p>What about pictures, that&rsquo;s probably the single busiest activity outside of updating status. Here I know of multiple friends that have attempted to use the site&rsquo;s interface for uploading pictures, only to have completed in double the time expected with much much more frustration than anticipated. Meanwhile, I simple select the photos I want to upload in iPhoto (there are options for mac and pc here), select export, click facebook, and off they go. This is the way it should be, I can do likewise for smugmug, flickr, etc.</p>

<p>Facebook has done a reasonable job at giving developers access to to facebook to allow them to build reasonable applications. While there&rsquo;s a lot of junk out there, there is also some reasonable applications to really make facebook a reasonable utility. The problem lies that these seem to be hidden gems, whether its facebook or some third party, someone needs to start bringing these to the attention of others. Unless facebook transitions to themselves as strictly a utility and differentiates themselves on the quality of service the utility gives, and less on their UI and stronghold of data, they will be in for a world of hurt in a few years.</p>

			Web 2.5</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about web 2.0, talked about web 3.0, but today realized theres still a middle ground we have to reach in between the two. It&rsquo;s quite a pain that I really have no idea when my friends do certain things online. While some use facebook for absolutely everything, this is most certainly NOT the best option. Throwing your data into their walled garden is one thing, but for this to be the one and only place you store your online data is quite stupid. Facebook will only open up when they&rsquo;re absolutely forced to, and may not even open up then. To migrate &lsquo;notes&rsquo; or rather blog posts out of facebook, or all of your pictures, or you&rsquo;re messages can be an absolute pain. Why not use a service built for just those things, such as a wordpress blog, or flickr/picasa, or twitter/jaiku? Well most people don&rsquo;t because of the simplicity of facebook being the central place for your data and your friend&rsquo;s data.</p>

<p>Well there is a solution to it, though it&rsquo;s not ideal yet, it will soon hit a tipping point of when it will be the solution. Well first I guess I should clearly layout the problem:</p>

<p>web 2.0 &ndash; the dynamic web emerged, users started publishing content
&hellip;. Mass amounts of data, problems getting to it all &hellip;..</p>

<p>thus in the future we have&hellip;
web 2.5 &ndash; content aggregation became nessecary, via friend feed</p>

<p>and eventually&hellip;
web 3.0 &ndash; the semantic web, services understand you and your needs and provide content around context</p>

<p>In short this is a small plug for friendfeed, but if anyone else knows of a better service to in essence create a feed of you, please send them this way. I&rsquo;ll be posting a full review on friendfeed soon, but for the time being just want to point out the value in such a service. Right now I post on multiple sites, I twitter, I blog, I use facebook, I use smugmug, I use picasa, I use last.fm, I use ilike, I use librarything, I use tumblr, I use google talk, among others. While personally I might be a little more invested than most, still the point remains that a lot of people are on more than one of these services. While I know them and follow them on the ones I know about, chances are I will never see their flickr accounts, or last.fm accounts. While some people worry about privacy and this being a stalker&rsquo;s nightmare, I really don&rsquo;t see it making things that much easier. Much less, most people are making a pretty big assumption assuming that they&rsquo;re worth being stalked. I personally hope I could have a stalker come out of such, as it would give me a definifitive answer that someone actually reads and find me interesting. I just hope she&rsquo;s 5&#8217;6&#8221;, and a blonde bombshell, but then again I&rsquo;ll take whatever stalkers I can get.</p>

<p>But the point remains that before we get to web 3.0 and the ability to deliver content based on context, we need to aggregate the content. Sites like friendfeed (and eventually socialthing) are a reasonable first step.</p>
