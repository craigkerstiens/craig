			How to Succeed in the Workplace? Go to Lunch!</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Something I learned very early on in my working career, not so much from my experiences but from observing the results of others, was to engage at a social level as early possible. This doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to take time after 5:00 to get to know someone, the best opportunity exists every single day during what you would already do, lunch! Everyone usually takes a break and eats lunch during the day, usually there&rsquo;s two groups in an office. Those that always go out, and those that bring their lunch or meet others for lunch or maybe even work through it. If you notice those in the first group in your office my guess it&rsquo;s usually easier for them to get things done, they&rsquo;re normally a little more in touch with things that are going on. Especially if you can manage to branch out a little and go outside of the people you work with every moment of the day.</p>

			Building Apps From the Echo Chamber</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;">A few days ago myself and another were providing our thoughts and insight into a mockup that someone had created for a product they&#8217;re working on. At my first glance I noticed it and said wow, that looks pretty awesome. It wasn&#8217;t until a few minutes in that someone else said, if we all like this, you&#8217;re probably doing something wrong. Meaning that, we&#8217;re tech geeks, we&#8217;re silicon valley to a T, we like control and power, we like having the ability to set notification levels for every friend we have, for every minute of the day. But middle-america doesn&#8217;t use those features, much less they don&#8217;t use any products that have those features.</p>


<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px;"></p>


<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;">This quickly got us back to the question, who are you targetting, is it middle-america house wives, silicon valley geeks, busy executives. In any application that should always be your starting point. I&#8217;ll likely have much more on this piece later, but jumping back to the echo chamber users.</p>


<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px;"></p>


<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;">Probably the easiest way to illustrate this is twitter vs. friendfeed. Robert Scoble has said many many times FriendFeed is so much better, so much more than twitter. The biggest problem is that I can&#8217;t explain friend feed to my mom. I can explain twitter and she gets it. She can log in to twitter and understand it. Friendfeed there&#8217;s far to much a user has to do to get comfortable with it.</p>


<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px;"></p>


<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;">Any new mainstream application that launches should do everything transparent to the user. In that the application should seem like it&#8217;s almost doing nothing, it should be magic under the covers. A user should have to search to find the ability to configure it, you should gather information on your user, and make assumptions on what they want. If you get it even 50% right you&#8217;re likely to retain and engage more users than allowing them the ability to configure exactly what they want.</p>

		<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;">For some time I&#8217;ve planned to found my own company some day. It&#8217;s one thing to work your way up through other companies and potentially lead a company, but my strong suspicion is it&#8217;s an entirely different and rewarding experience to build something from the ground up. Two key things I&#8217;ve decided (as it will likely be a somewhat technical company i&#8217;ll found):</p>

		<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;">For some time I&#8217;ve always felt there was value in having a mentor. Though over the course of my life I&#8217;ve seldom setup a formal mentor, though looking back I supposed I could nearly consider many people such a person. Rather than just stress the value of having a mentor I&#8217;d like to look at the value such a relationship can provide. Whether you get those pieces of value in a formal mentor situation or just through dinner with people the key is to grow.</p>


<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px;"></p>

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;">1. Find someone to learn from</p>


<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px;"></p>


<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;">The obvious first step you should take is to get face time with those that are more experienced and have done it before. This is usually something that younger people that have not been out of school long steer away from approaching those with experience. Perhaps its intimidation, perhaps its that you feel they don&#8217;t think it would be worth their time. But from my personal experience I&#8217;m normally more than happy to help anyone that asks, and likewise anytime I&#8217;ve asked someone I&#8217;ve gotten positive results. This is usually as simple as can we get dinner/lunch/coffee sometime?</p>


<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px;"></p>


<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;">It should be pretty obvious who you may want to spend this time with. If it&#8217;s not then start simply take a boss, teacher, or some manager/supervisor in a lateral department.</p>

			Takeaways From Consulting</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;">Having spent most of my early career in consulting and now being at a software company I&#8217;m realizing there were a lot of principles I picked up that I now readily apply in my daily happenings. As I find myself interacting with most of my colleagues, many of whom have only been in software companies, these principles are as evident.</p>


<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px;"></p>


<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;">1. Listen to the problems not the solutions</p>


<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px;"></p>


<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;">Often times in early interacting with a customer people will ask what do you need. As a consultant I would never ask what they needed, if they knew this I wouldn&#8217;t be there. Instead, I ask about their problems. It&#8217;s then my job to take what they tell me about their problems, their environment, and then steer them in the direction of an appropriate solution. While very basic this is the key to consulting, asking the right questions to steer your customer so you can provide value.</p>

			Why Google Wave Will Fail</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Google doesn&rsquo;t understand social or collaboration. There&rsquo;s not much more to it than that, though for the sake of making this a an actual blog post I&rsquo;ll explain a bit more.</p>

<p>Blogger was huge, it was the place to go if you were creating a blog. There weren&rsquo;t many www.mybloghere.com, many of the largest most popular blogs on the internet were on blogger. People had accounts, people registered to post comments, people had full fledged profiles that could have easily preceded a facebook profile page. Google bought blogger and had more than enough resources to grow blogger into a sizable social community. But if you visit it looks much the same as it did 5 and almost 10 years ago.</p>

<p>Google spreadsheets is one of the best online spreadsheet programs, and you can even collectively work on a spreadsheet with others at the same time thousands of miles away. Who do you know that uses google spreadsheets that isn&rsquo;t some form of a techie? It likely has a user base of under 1% of users of spreadsheets, and its not because it&rsquo;s missing the power features of pivot tables and such. If you re-brand it as a collaboration tool when working and throw chat/video/whiteboarding in the same application google would have an instant growth 10 fold of users, but they don&rsquo;t understand that a user seeing the same thing on a spreadsheet and seeing what the other types in a single document isn&rsquo;t collaboration!</p>

<p>To jump ahead of the curve, counter arguments I&rsquo;ve already heard are around ads and gmail. Gmail, google didn&rsquo;t improve email, they simply give you lots of space for free, if gmail were to cease to exist tomorrow users would simply jump over to yahoo or microsoft. Ads, google changed the ad industry by making search effective, they&rsquo;re good at algorithms and such, but they don&rsquo;t get users and collaboration, and at their current rate they never will.</p>

<p>Wave isn&rsquo;t meant to just improve email, it&rsquo;s meant to be a tool for collaboration, to view a conversation as an entity, and google just doesn&rsquo;t get the conversation part.</p>

			The Benefit of Leverage</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Due to many recent events, which I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll disclose later, I&rsquo;ve been in an interesting situation of a good bit of leverage. While leverage can of course be taken advantage of and misused, it also plays a very fair role in business. When hiring a new college graduate in most cases you take the offer you are given, some are able to negotiate for a higher salary, but most are quite unsuccessful. This is because they don&rsquo;t have any leverage. If you ended up walking away from the job offer they would simply hire another college graduate. While yes you may have a lot of potential, it&rsquo;s only that potential and not proven.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Additionally within a corporation, the company will often do just enough to keep an employee there. If a company does a great job, an employee gets a pat on the back. If an employee is indispensable (though no company will ever admit to this), they may get a noticeable reward, but it still doesn&rsquo;t usually cover the value the individual is actually providing.</p>

<p>This responsibility to get what you are truly worth usually lies with the employee. The hard part of this, is knowing when and how to use your leverage. First you must actually have leverage, this commonly in potential revenue you would bring in, or internal knowledge that you may have. Though I&rsquo;m sure others have varying experiences, mine have been to make your dissatisfaction with a situation known, but in a light manner. Meanwhile make it visible that you&rsquo;re open to other opportunities as they may come along, this can be via twitter, blog post, or water cooler talk. The final thing, and hopefully this is an easier one, is make it clear that you have the leverage, the sale should be a big one, or the internal knowledge should be costly should they lose it.</p>

<p>The most unfortunate part of all of this is that, in my experiences the leverage is typically needed to get a fair deal. And the single point of requiring leverage no longer makes it fair, but at least knowing this ensures you&rsquo;re not left out in the cold.</p>

			Why Twitter Is About to Get Old</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Twitter has finally hit mainstream, it was bound to happen and with Ashton, Oprah, Shaq, among many others it&rsquo;s now going to be around for a while. This means a lot of interesting things for twitter such as scalability to handle this new massive growth which will be much more regular unlike the more sparse spikes they would see before. But as user of twitter it means something far different, it means twitter is about to run out of usefulness. Before twitter was a nice resource to be able to regularly communicate with micromessaging, now it&rsquo;s quickly going to become one of the noisiest things on the web. This would be a fine case, IF there were ways to manage the noise. However with twitter you either get really focused drops or the entire firehose, there is no medium in between. Sure twitter searches can be nice, but this requires maybe 20-30 constant searches to be up to date on what you care about.</p>

<p>If someone is able to find some way to manage the firehose of information it will prove as valuable tool as twitter itself. But if that doesn&rsquo;t happen in a respectable time, twitter is going to get really exciting to a lot of people, and just as quickly turn a lot of people off.</p>

			Takeaways for a Startup</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&rsquo;ve learned a great deal since being out in the valley, first, is the confirmation that I do love the atmosphere. Second that I really miss the fall, but more importantly I&rsquo;ve learned a lot that I feel is useful in a startup environment. The startup environment and business model is a very unique one, especially in recent years. It seems to not require a business model to get someone just to give you $10 million and hope you come out with one at some point. And in some cases it works, I mean it did for google, but well the failure stories are a lot more abudant than the success ones.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick run down of how I think one can build a successful startup in any economy, and why I feel our current state is prime for someone following these steps.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Have a business model. Yeah, it&rsquo;s less glamorous that a facebook that has millions of people log on to it each hour. Take for example the guys at 37 signals, they&rsquo;re probably happy to get a million uniques in a month, or perhaps even a year. But per employee, per their cost, their revenues are at least 10x if not 100x of facebook&rsquo;s. And they most likely see that in revenue per employee as well. Why is this the case? Simple put, they have a business model. They have some product they build and people want it, not want it in the sense that they will spend hours of time aimlessly using it if its free and convenient. It accomplishes some actual goal, and saves people time and makes their lives easier. Oh and something I&rsquo;ve probably said too many times on here, but ad&rsquo;s isn&rsquo;t a business model, unless your specifically an ad company.</p></li>
<li><p>Get competent employees, I want to even take this a step further and say to get employees that believe in the technology but also in the business. Its one thing when your at a large company to have someone that&rsquo;s extremely specialized. But at a startup everyone wears a variety of hats. Your secretary could land a big lead on a sale, your intern developer could come up with your future marketing slogan, and because of this everyone you bring on board needs to be fully on board with every aspect of your business. If you&rsquo;re growing slower than you hoped it&rsquo;s fine, and worth it to be short rather than over inflated.</p></li>
<li><p>Part of the reason you&rsquo;d rather be short than inflated is you don&rsquo;t want to take on capital. To quote someone else I&rsquo;ve recently come into contact with, &lsquo;you want to get off the tit as fast as possible&rsquo;. To give a little more explanation, most startups take sizable investments from VC&rsquo;s or other parties to get going. The problem here is that you then have to answer to them, if you&rsquo;re the one with the idea, with the vision, why would you want to give up any control of that. And the fact is you shouldn&rsquo;t, going back to point 1 and 2, if you have the business model it shouldn&rsquo;t be long before you see revenue, and if all your employees believe in the company, they wont expect a high cushy salary, they&rsquo;ll take ownership in the company as part of their compensation.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep your employees happy, the easiest way to do this is pizza and beer. It&rsquo;s simple, but works. If you have happy employees enjoying what they do they&rsquo;ll work harder and longer. The smaller you are the more poisonous it is to have employees that don&rsquo;t fit in and embrace your culture. Sure diversity can be a good thing, and you do need some balance of it. But more than that you don&rsquo;t want to ruin the atmosphere and comraderier that comes along with a startup. In addition to keeping your employees happy those small things help, pizza and beer for 20 to get an extra hour of work and the intangibles of helping build relationships that allow them to work better is far cheaper than paying them extra dollars to work late.</p></li>
<li><p>Don&rsquo;t overspend, this may seem in contrast to 4, and often times poeple go with one extreme or the other. Pizza and beer makes sense, Lobster lunches do not, I don&rsquo;t care if you are google, they still don&rsquo;t make sense. If you are doing extremely well and want to give back to employees give it with cash, they&rsquo;ll appreciate it more. Bsimilar search for John McCain shows a normal pro-McCainut order in lunches every day and pool tables are no necessary expenses.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>If there&rsquo;s enough response I&rsquo;ll follow up with some of the more tangible ways of making this happen, but for now, enjoy these big picture take aways.</p>

			All the Bubbles Haven&#8217;t Burst Yet</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>As I watch the news and posts roll in each day with new layoffs in the valley, ranging from large corporations such as HP and EA, down to the small guys such as seesmic, imeem, searchme, and zillow to name only a few, there still seems to be a demand for <a href="http://nettuts.com/articles/10-most-sought-after-skills-in-web-development/">certain job skills</a>. While as I look down the list some of these I dont feel are any longer demanded skills, and others will soon be there. In part I want to call attention to facebook first. While everyone and their brother, when launching a website wants to build a facebook app to deliver some of their content on to facebook, the time and effort put into this is no where near the return. The market has become so flooded the penetration you will get is quite trivial. Futhermore cpm&rsquo;s have already plummeted for advertising on facebook, ranging in some cases around .10-.15.</p>

<p>Meanwhile iphone developers are still rushing to get their idea into the app store. While a decent idea, and I more than support new applications, so that I can use them on my phone, a 10 million person marketplace is still extremely small, especially if you&rsquo;re not a mainstream application. It used to be that one million users on your website was the golden point in social networks when you could really go for significant funding, or you could start talking a selling price. But thats not the case anymore, much less to reach that on the iphone you would have to be somewhere between the top 10 and top 25 elite apps. </p>

<p>So sure, you might not have that many users that download your app right? But theres ad revenue possibilities. Well that works right now, the iphone is seeing insane cpm&rsquo;s in some cases as high as $50. This is simply not sustainable. While some claim that mobile advertising is the holy grail of ad&rsquo;s, that only works if you can capture user intent, which in contrast isn&rsquo;t so simple. It works for search, because well when I&rsquo;m searching for something that usually captures my intent, not so for when I&rsquo;m using my phone. I strongly suspect that as these new hot markets calm down, companies will do proper analysis of ROI and no longer want many of these niche skills.</p>

<p>In these cases I think there&rsquo;s going to be able more smaller bubbles bursting and a lot more niche developers searching for something more than developing the occasional website for the store down the street.</p>
