			A Year&#8217;s Look at Postgres</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A couple years back I started more regularly blogging, though I&rsquo;ve done this off and on before, this time I kept some regularity. A common theme started to emerge with some content on Postgres about once a month because most of what was out there was much more reference oriented. A bit after that I connected with <a href="http://www.twitter.com/peterc">petercooper</a>, who runs quite a few weekly email newsletters. As someone thats been interested helping give others a good reason to create content the obvious idea of <a href="http://www.postgresweekly.com">Postgres Weekly</a> emerged.</p>

<p>Since then we&rsquo;ve now had the newsletter running for over a year, helped surface quite a bit of content, and grown to over 5,000 subscribers. First if you&rsquo;re not subscribed, then go <a href="http://www.postgresweekly.com">subscribe now</a>.</p>

<p>And if you need some inspiration or just want to reminisce with me&hellip; here&rsquo;s a look back at a few highlights over the past year:</p>

		<p>Just a few weeks back I wrote a article discussing many of the things that were likely to miss making the <a href="http://www.craigkerstiens.com/2014/02/15/PostgreSQL-9.4-What-I-Wanted/">9.4 PostgreSQL release</a>. Since that post a few weeks ago the landscape has already changed, and much more for the positive.</p>

<p><em>The lesson here, is never count Postgres out</em>. As <a href="www.linuxinsider.com/story/Bruce-Momjian-PostrgreSQL-Prefers-the-Scenic-Route-80045.html">Bruce discussed in a recent interview</a>, Postgres is slow and steady, but much like the turtle can win the race.</p>

		<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/3f1q2N2s2V0d0G2s1T01/Blank.jpg" style="float:right;margin-left:20px;"/> In analyzing a business I commonly look at reports that have two lenses, one is by doing various cohort analysis. The other is that I look for Month over Month or Week over Week or some other X over X growth in terms of a percentage. This second form of looking at data is relevant when you&rsquo;re in a SaaS business or essentially anythign that does recurring billing. In such a business focusing on your MRR and working on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003XVYKRW?tag=mypred-20">growing your MRR is how success can often be measured</a>.</p>

		<p>Theres no doubt that the <a href="/2014/02/02/Examining-PostgreSQL-9.4/">9.4 release</a> of PostgreSQL will have some great improvements. However, for all of the improvements it delivering it had the promise of being perhaps the most impactful release of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008IGIKY6?tag=mypred-20">Postgres</a> yet. Several of the features that would have given it my stamp of best release in at least 5 years are now already not making it and a few others are still on the border. Here&rsquo;s a look at few of the things that were hoped for and not to be at least until another 18 months.</p>

			How I Hack Email</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In a conversation with <a href="http://www.twitter.com/alexbaldwin">@alexbaldwin</a> yesterday the topic of email came up, with each of us quickly diving into various observations, how its both awesome and a great form of communication/engagement, how most people still do it really bad. Alex has some good experience with it with hack design having over 100,000 subscribers. A tangent in an entirely unrelated meeting with <a href="http://www.twitter.com/mschoening">@mschoening</a> and others it was suggested instead of emailing a list to send out a ton of individual emails instead. Both of these reminded me that email is incredibly powerful, but taking advantage of its power has to be intentional.</p>

<p>This is not about ways to get to inbox 0 or better manage your inflow of emails. Rather its about how to get the maximum output out of emails that you send, or minimum output depending on what you prefer.</p>

At the same time there&rsquo;s still a lot on the bubble that may or may not make it which could entirely change the shape of this one. For a peek back of some of the past ones:</p>

			Where to Go With Developer Content</a>
	</h2>

		<p>Last week I wrote up some <a href="/2014/01/16/developer-marketing-where-to-start-with-content/">initial steps for getting started with marketing a developer</a> focused product. The short of it was quite trying to do &ldquo;marketing&rdquo; and just start putting out interesting material. A big part of this is sourcing material from your company&rsquo;s developers. From there you want to gradually shift it from simply interesting technical posts to things that align with your core beliefs and add value to your customers.</p>

<p>Perhaps the easiest way to do this is by highlighting some examples of it.</p>

			Rethinking the Limits on Relational Databases</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Theres a lot of back and forth on NoSQL databases. The unfortunate part with all the back and forth and unclear definitions of NoSQL is that many of the valuable learnings are lost. This post isn&rsquo;t about the differences in NoSQL definitions, but rather some of the huge benefits that do exist in whats often grouped into the schema-less world that could easily be applied to the relational world.</p>

<h3>Forget migrations</h3>

<p>Perhaps the best thing about the idea of a schemaless database is that you can just push code and it works. Almost exactly five years ago Heroku shipped <code>git push heroku master</code> letting you simply push code from git and it just work. CouchDB and MongoDB have done similar for databases&hellip; you don&rsquo;t have to run <code>CREATE TABLE</code> or <code>ALTER TABLE</code> migrations before working with your database. There&rsquo;s something wonderful about just building and shipping your application without worrying about migrations.</p>

			Where to Start With Developer Content</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Commonly at developer focused companies the question from a marketing team will come up of &ldquo;How do we get content that developers find interesting&rdquo;? Or how can I get our developers to blog more? Or some other similar question. I general the question of creating content and engaging with developers is a very common one, and often theres a mismatch between what marketing wants to do and what developers appreciate.</p>

<h3>Stop marketing</h3>

<p>Forget trying to &ldquo;market&rdquo; to developers. Hopefully you at least have developers that believe in the product their building, if thats not the case then find a new product or a new team. If you&rsquo;ve got a product targetted at developers and a team that believes in it then you&rsquo;re already half way there to marketing it. Now back to the first point, forget trying to market it. Start with building some form of an audience, reputation, respect among other developers. This isn&rsquo;t done through ads, email marketing, SEO or any of that. Its done by creating content that developers find interesting, as a first step forget your product entirely, but don&rsquo;t worry we&rsquo;ll get there soon enough.</p>

			The Best Postgres Feature You&#8217;re Not Using – CTEs Aka WITH Clauses</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>SQL by default isn&rsquo;t typically friendly to dive into, and especially so if you&rsquo;re reading someone else&rsquo;s already created queries. For some reason most people throw out principles we follow in other languages <a href="http://www.craigkerstiens.com/2013/07/29/documenting-your-postgres-database/">such as commenting</a> and composability just for SQL. I was recently reminded of a key feature in Postgres that most don&rsquo;t use by <a href="http://www.twitter.com/timonk">@timonk</a> highlighting it in his AWS Re:Invent Redshift talk. The simple feature actually makes SQL both readable and composable, and even for my own queries capable of coming back to them months later and understanding them, where previously they would not be.</p>

<p>The feature itself is known as CTEs or common table expressions, you may also here it referred to as <code>WITH</code> clauses. The general idea is that it allows you to create something somewhat equivilant to a view that only exists during that transaction. You can create multiple of these which then allow for clear building blocks and make it simple to follow what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
