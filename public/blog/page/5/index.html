			Using Postgres Arrays in Django</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A few weeks back I did a brief <a href="/2012/08/20/arrays-in-postgres/">feature highlight on Postgres arrays</a>. Since that time I&rsquo;ve found myself using them with increasing regularity on small side projects. Much of this time I&rsquo;m using Django and of course not opting to write raw SQL to be able to use arrays. Django actually makes it quite simple to work with Arrays in Postgres with a package by <a href="http://www.niwi.be/about.html">Andrey Antukh</a>. Lets get started by installing two libraries:</p>

<pre><code>pip install djorm-ext-pgarray
pip install djorm-ext-expressions
</code></pre>

<p>The first library is for support for the array field type, the second allows us to more easily mix bits of SQL within the Django ORM.</p>

			Redis in My Postgres</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Yesterday there was a post which hit <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4664178">Hacker News</a> that talked about using <a href="http://www.citusdata.com/blog/51-run-sql-on-mongodb">SQL to access Mongo</a>. While this is powerful I think much of the true value was entirely missed within the post.</p>

<p>SQL is an expressive language, though people are often okay with accessing Mongo data through its own ORM. The real value is that you could actually query the data from within Postgres then join across your data stores, without having to do some ETL process to move data around.  Think&hellip; joining sales data from Postgres with user reviews stored in Mongo or searching for visits to a website (retained in redis) against purchases by user in Postgres.</p>

<p>The mechanism pointed out was a MongoDB Foreign Data Wrapper. A Foreign Data Wrapper or FDW essentially lets you connect to an external datastore from within a Postgres database. In addition to the Mongo FDW released the other day there&rsquo;s  many others. For example Postgres 9.0 and up ships with one called <code>db_link</code>, which lets you query and join across two different Postgres databases. Beyond that there&rsquo;s support for a variety of other data stores including some you may have never expected:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://pgxn.org/dist/redis_fdw/">Redis</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pgxn.org/dist/file_textarray_fdw/">Textfile</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pgxn.org/dist/mysql_fdw/">MySQL</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pgxn.org/dist/oracle_fdw/">Oracle</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pgxn.org/dist/odbc_fdw/">ODBC</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pgxn.org/dist/ldap_fdw/">LDAP</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pgxn.org/dist/twitter_fdw/">Twitter</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pgxn.org/tag/fdw/">More</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Lets look at actually getting the Redis one running then see what some of the power of it really looks like. First we have to get the code then build it:</p>

			Understanding Postgres Performance</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><em>Update theres a more <a href="/2013/01/10/more-on-postgres-performance/">recent post that expands further on where to start optimizing</a> specific queries, and of course if you want to dig into optimizing your infrastructure <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/184951030X?tag=mypred-20">High Performance PostgreSQL is still a great read</a></em></p>

<p>For many application developers their database is a black box. Data goes in, comes back out and in between there developers hope its a pretty short time span. Without becoming a DBA there&rsquo;s a few pieces of data that most application developers can easily grok which will help them understand if their database is performing adequately. This post will provide some quick tips that allow you to determine whether your database performance is slowing down your app, and if so what you can do about it.</p>

<h3>Understanding your Cache and its Hit Rate</h3>

<p>The typical rule for most applications is that only a fraction of its data is regularly accessed. As with many other things data can tend to follow the 80/20 rule with 20% of your data accounting for 80% of the reads and often times its higher than this. Postgres itself actually tracks access patterns of your data and will on its own keep frequently accessed data in cache. Generally you want your database to have a cache hit rate of about 99%. You can find your cache hit rate with:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
  sum(heap_blks_read) as heap_read,
  sum(heap_blks_hit)  as heap_hit,
  sum(heap_blks_hit) / (sum(heap_blks_hit) + sum(heap_blks_read)) as ratio
FROM 
  pg_statio_user_tables;
</code></pre>

			Arrays in Postgres</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Postgres out of the box has an abundance of datatypes, from standard <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/datatype.html#DATATYPE-NUMERIC">numeric datatypes</a> to <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/datatype-geometric.html">geometric</a> or even <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/datatype-net-types.html">network datatypes</a>. With extensions you can get even more out of it as earlier discussed with <a href="http://craigkerstiens.com/2012/06/11/schemaless-django/">hStore</a>. Though with all of the datatypes its easy to miss out on some of them that are there, in fact one of my favorites is often missed entirely. The <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/arrays.html">Array</a> datatype lets you do just as you&rsquo;d expect, store an array inside Postgres. With this you can often get some of the functionality you&rsquo;d want in a single table when you might traditionally have expanded to multiple tables.</p>

<p>The broader question may be why you&rsquo;d actually want to use an array. One good reason may be if you&rsquo;re an application developer its how you think of your data, so why not model it the same way. As you&rsquo;ll see below it can be easier than joining and aggregating across a set of rows. Also depending on your case you performance could be improved, though mileage may vary here as it does depend on the data you&rsquo;re storing.</p>

<p>First a bit of a hacky example&hellip; Lets say you have a basic website that sells stuff, and instead of having a purchase ID and a total you want to include the quantity, id, and price of each item in a single row. With a bit of a messy foreign key (using a decimal) you could store all of this within a single row:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE purchases (
    id integer NOT NULL,
    user_id integer,
    items decimal(10,2) [100][1],
    occurred_at timestamp
);
</code></pre>

<p>With this table I could have an array that holds multiple records of:</p>

<ul>
<li>The item purchased</li>
<li>The quantity</li>
<li>The price</li>
</ul>

			Rapid API Prototyping With Heroku Postgres Dataclips</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>For small and large applications there often comes a time where you&rsquo;re busy creating an API. The API creation process usually takes the form of something like: Design your API, Implement your API, Test and Evaluate, Rinse and Repeat. Often you&rsquo;re unable to tell how you truly feel about your API without fully implementing it, causing this cycle to take longer than it should. Heroku Postgres has Dataclips, which (among other things) can be used for quickly prototyping APIs. Lets take a look at how this would work:</p>

			Protips for Conference Talks</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A few weeks ago I was sitting at the hotel in Zurich with <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jacobian">Jacob Kaplan Moss</a> prior to <a href="http://klewel.com/conferences/djangocon-2012/">DjangoCon EU</a> enjoying a beer, talking about Django, and discussing a bit about our upcoming talks for the conference. He talked briefly about his upcoming <a href="http://klewel.com/conferences/djangocon-2012/index.php?talkID=2">keynote</a> and how he was doing something different, including essentially 5 mini-talks. This seemed interesting enough, but the part that surprised me was when Jacob said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m among friends here so it&rsquo;ll be a good place to test this format.&rdquo; Many if not all in the community know who Jacob is as one of the creators of Django, though still to be &ldquo;among friends&rdquo; at a roughly 300 person conference surprised me. However, as someone thats keynoted several times, spoken at conferences for many years, and familiar with many people in the community; for the 150-200 people there he had not met before, he was still truly among friends. While giving a keynote is never an easy feat, it seems to ease the worry ahead of time of doing such.</p>

<p>Saturday night there was a bit of conversation on twitter that had some related discussion. In the last minute rush for DjangoCon US talk submissions a few that have been involved in the community for some time discussed submitting their first talk proposals. In parallel to that was some discussion around diversity, I volunteered the idea of not including presenters name&rsquo;s in the list when reviewing and voting on talks. While both of the above are controversial topics alone, I hope that can be left to another later time. The key idea that emerged that can be helpful to anyone looking to submit a talk to a conference is how the &ldquo;pro&rsquo;s do it&rdquo;, as <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jdunck">Jeremy Dunck</a> put it.</p>

<p>So without further adieu, hopefully without speaking too much for him here&rsquo;s likely why Jacob viewed his 300 person keynote as being among friends:</p>

<h2>1. Start small</h2>

<p>Whether its practicing the talk itself or writing the abstract for a proposal practicing each step lets you refine this well ahead of time. In my experience, providing a talk description for a meetup can often be far harder than for a conference. For a meetup I feel confined to 2-3 sentences, versus an abstract a solid paragraph or two. Yet, I still have to make it as exciting, because of course I don&rsquo;t want 4 people to show up to the meetup because it sounds uninteresting. In the case I&rsquo;m most familiar with <a href="http://www.djangocon.us/">DjangoCon</a> and DjangoCon.eu both happen once a year, though many smaller regional conferences related to Python exist and especially meetup groups:</p>

			Schemaless Postgres in Django</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Earlier this week while I was at <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2012/djangocon-europe/">DjangoCon EU</a> there seemed to be a surprising amount of talk about MongoDB. My problem with this isn&rsquo;t with MongoDB, but in  the assumption that only Mongo can solve what you&rsquo;re looking for. By and far the most common feature is people want schemaless. It gives them flexibility in their data model and lets them iterate quickly. While I still opt for relational models that map cleanly to a relational database, there are cases where developers may want schemaless. I gave a quick lightning talk on this with slides <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/u/craigkerstiens/p/django-and-hstore">here</a>, but it is worth recapping.</p>

<p>The example given by <a href="http://www.twitter.com/pydanny">pydanny</a> was a product catalog. You may have different items you want to store for a catalog. Lets take an example below:</p>

<pre><code>django_pony = {'name': 'Django Pony', 'rating': '5'}
pink_pony = {'name': 'Pink Pony', 'rating': '4', 'color': 'pink'}
</code></pre>

<p>In the case of a product catalog it could be understandable you don&rsquo;t want to normalize every possible spec for the product. The argument for Mongo is so commonly that you can easily work with this data model. Admittedly it is quite simple:</p>

<pre><code>from pymongo import Connection
connection = Connection()
django_pony = {'name': 'Django Pony', 'rating': '5'}
connection.product.insert(django_pony)
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that this assumes other schemaless options don&rsquo;t exist or are inferior.</p>

<h2>Enter hStore</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/static/hstore.html">hStore</a> is a column type within Postgres. It is a key value store that allows you to store a dictionary, with text values. It alone is not a full document store replacement, but allows for flexibility in your data model where you need it while letting you use relational models elsewhere. Its not exactly new within Postgres either, as its been available since 8.4, however its recently become easier to work with and is supported in some form or another by more frameworks.</p>

<p>To do the same as above we only need to do a few steps:</p>

To help consolidate many of these, here&rsquo;s a second list of the many reasons to use PostgreSQL:</p>

<h2>Create Index Concurrently</h2>

<p>On most traditional databases when you create an index it holds a lock on the table while it creates the index. This means that the table is more or less useless during that time. When you&rsquo;re starting out this isn&rsquo;t a problem, but as your data grows and you then add indexes later to improve performance it could mean downtime just to add an index. Not surprisingly Postgres has a great means of adding an index without holding that lock. Simply doing <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/sql-createindex.html#SQL-CREATEINDEX-CONCURRENTLY"><code>CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY</code></a> instead of <code>CREATE INDEX</code> will create your index without holding the lock.</p>

<p><em>Of course with many features there are caveats, in the case of creating your index concurrently it does take somewhere on the order of 2-3 times longer, and cannot be done within a transaction</em></p>

<h2>Transactional DDL</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever run a migration had something break mid-way, either due to a constraint or some other means you understand what pain can come of quickly untangling such. Typically migrations on a schema are intended to be run holistically and if they fail you want to fully rollback. Some other databases such as Oracle in recent versions and SQL server do support, this. And of course Postgres supports wrapping your DDL inside a transaction. This means if an error does occur you can simply rollback and have the previous DDL statements rolled back with it, leaving your schema migrations as safe as your data, and your application in a consistent state.</p>

<h2>Foreign Data Wrappers</h2>

<p>I talked before about other languages within your database such as Ruby or Python, but what if you wanted to talk to other databases from your database. Postgres&rsquo;s Foreign Data Wrapper allows you to fully wrap external data systems and join on them in a similar fashion to as if they existed locally within the database. Here&rsquo;s a sampling of just a few of the foreign data wrappers that exist:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://pgxn.org/dist/oracle_fdw/">Oracle</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pgxn.org/dist/mysql_fdw/">MySQL</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pgxn.org/dist/redis_fdw/">Redis</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pgxn.org/dist/twitter_fdw/">Twitter</a></li>
</ul>


<p>In fact you can even use <a href="http://multicorn.org/">Multicorn</a> to allow you to write other foreign data wrappers in Python. An example of how this can be done, in this case with Database.com/Force.com can be found <a href="http://blog.database.com/blog/2011/11/21/a-database-comforce-com-foreign-data-wrapper-for-postgresql/">here</a></p>

	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>First a huge thanks to all organizers of conferences, but especially for those that organize not-for-profit conferences. I do understand its a great amount of work, and in nearly all cases have greatly appreciated the experience made available by the work they put into it.</p>

<p>As for some guidance. I&rsquo;ve been on nearly all sides of the conference with the exception of organizing, so again organizers please don&rsquo;t take offense to the feedback.</p>

<h2>First on timeline</h2>

<p><em>Please publish this early on your site and on <a href="http://www.lanyrd.com">lanyrd</a></em></p>
