		<p>Theres no doubt that the <a href="/2014/02/02/Examining-PostgreSQL-9.4/">9.4 release</a> of PostgreSQL will have some great improvements. However, for all of the improvements it delivering it had the promise of being perhaps the most impactful release of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008IGIKY6?tag=mypred-20">Postgres</a> yet. Several of the features that would have given it my stamp of best release in at least 5 years are now already not making it and a few others are still on the border. Here&rsquo;s a look at few of the things that were hoped for and not to be at least until another 18 months.</p>

			How I Hack Email</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In a conversation with <a href="http://www.twitter.com/alexbaldwin">@alexbaldwin</a> yesterday the topic of email came up, with each of us quickly diving into various observations, how its both awesome and a great form of communication/engagement, how most people still do it really bad. Alex has some good experience with it with hack design having over 100,000 subscribers. A tangent in an entirely unrelated meeting with <a href="http://www.twitter.com/mschoening">@mschoening</a> and others it was suggested instead of emailing a list to send out a ton of individual emails instead. Both of these reminded me that email is incredibly powerful, but taking advantage of its power has to be intentional.</p>

<p>This is not about ways to get to inbox 0 or better manage your inflow of emails. Rather its about how to get the maximum output out of emails that you send, or minimum output depending on what you prefer.</p>

While its still going, which means there could still be more great features to come, we can start to take a look at what you can expect from it now. This release seems to bring a lot of minor increments versus some bigger highlights of previous ones. At the same time there&rsquo;s still a lot on the bubble that may or may not make it which could entirely change the shape of this one. For a peek back of some of the past ones:</p>

		<p>Last week I wrote up some <a href="/2014/01/16/developer-marketing-where-to-start-with-content/">initial steps for getting started with marketing a developer</a> focused product. The short of it was quite trying to do &ldquo;marketing&rdquo; and just start putting out interesting material. A big part of this is sourcing material from your company&rsquo;s developers. From there you want to gradually shift it from simply interesting technical posts to things that align with your core beliefs and add value to your customers.</p>

<p>Perhaps the easiest way to do this is by highlighting some examples of it.</p>

			Rethinking the Limits on Relational Databases</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Theres a lot of back and forth on NoSQL databases. The unfortunate part with all the back and forth and unclear definitions of NoSQL is that many of the valuable learnings are lost. This post isn&rsquo;t about the differences in NoSQL definitions, but rather some of the huge benefits that do exist in whats often grouped into the schema-less world that could easily be applied to the relational world.</p>

<h3>Forget migrations</h3>

<p>Perhaps the best thing about the idea of a schemaless database is that you can just push code and it works. Almost exactly five years ago Heroku shipped <code>git push heroku master</code> letting you simply push code from git and it just work. CouchDB and MongoDB have done similar for databases&hellip; you don&rsquo;t have to run <code>CREATE TABLE</code> or <code>ALTER TABLE</code> migrations before working with your database. There&rsquo;s something wonderful about just building and shipping your application without worrying about migrations.</p>

		<p>Getting the word out</p>

<h3>Hacker News</h3>

<p>When it comes to marketing, specifically to developers, the most common question is how do I get on Hacker News? The second most commong is, well in addition to there what matters. This fully depends on your audience, and if you really only care about the former versus the broader issue of creating a sustainable model for circulating your content then just read these links then move on. If you want a full model for getting your content out there then keep reading.</p>

<li><a href="http://alexstechthoughts.com/post/29406022580/how-to-get-on-the-frontpage-of-hacker-news">How to get on the front page of hacker news</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>More than just Hacker News</h3>

<p>First off don&rsquo;t get me wrong, HN can provide a great surge of short term traffic. There&rsquo;s a few problems I have with this though. To begin with it gives you one shot to get your message perfect, if you have the wrong message, miss your call to action, or forget an affiliate link then you get your 15k viewers well you get no second shot at it. Though more interestingly and a bit of gut feel, I&rsquo;ve noticed that traffic contains more bounes and lower engagement. And then theres the issue that its definitely not a science to getting on there&hellip;.</p>

<h3>Other news sites</h3>

<p>Of course theres other news sites, ones of relevance include reddit, dzone, monacle. I&rsquo;ve found each of these can be similar in some ways to hacker news. Yet, they have a bit longer of a shelf life, giving me a slightly higher propensity to give them some attention. At the same time they also have a smaller reach.</p>

<h3>Twitter</h3>

<p>Twitter is yet another method that can work quite well. Observations of it include lower traffic than something like a hacker news, and equal to better engagement overall. Perhaps the most interesting piece I find is that you&rsquo;ll often get more intelligent and also positive discussion on twitter vs. HN. There is one huge fail I find with twitter that nearly every company commits. The author of the post or company twitter handle posts it, then 10 people proceed to retweet it within 10 minutes. The problem with this if you&rsquo;re anything like places I&rsquo;ve worked at is you have a strong overlap of followers, this combined with the empheral nature of twitter means you&rsquo;re diminishing reach. Instead having a few people (dont make it a strict requirement) retweet later in the day can help broaden your reach.</p>

<h3>Google Plus</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m slightly ashamed to be including this on here&hellip; I don&rsquo;t use it, I don&rsquo;t care for it, etc. I have no hard evidence of this either, but publishing on Google Plus seems to speed up Google&rsquo;s indexing of the article to be much closer to instant. Take it for what you will.</p>

<h3>Email</h3>

<p>That thing you still get too much of is a great way of getting content out.</p>

<h3>Long tail</h3>

<p>Please please please do not underestimate the value in the long tail of your content. Google sends me between 200 and 500 new uniques a day due to various articles. Think about the areas you want to rank for and create your content for them, work on getting it out and syndicated, then</p>

			Where to Start With Developer Content</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Commonly at developer focused companies the question from a marketing team will come up of &ldquo;How do we get content that developers find interesting&rdquo;? Or how can I get our developers to blog more? Or some other similar question. I general the question of creating content and engaging with developers is a very common one, and often theres a mismatch between what marketing wants to do and what developers appreciate.</p>

<h3>Stop marketing</h3>

<p>Forget trying to &ldquo;market&rdquo; to developers. Hopefully you at least have developers that believe in the product their building, if thats not the case then find a new product or a new team. If you&rsquo;ve got a product targetted at developers and a team that believes in it then you&rsquo;re already half way there to marketing it. Now back to the first point, forget trying to market it. Start with building some form of an audience, reputation, respect among other developers. This isn&rsquo;t done through ads, email marketing, SEO or any of that. Its done by creating content that developers find interesting, as a first step forget your product entirely, but don&rsquo;t worry we&rsquo;ll get there soon enough.</p>

			Digging in With Foreign Tables</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I wrote a couple months back about exploring FDWs. Its become quite clear to me, despite still having ample room for improvement, they&rsquo;re not getting enough attention. Foreign data wrappers are perhaps better thought of as a foreign table, or even better yet as a view into some remote data source. They don&rsquo;t take care of auto-updating or syncing data, thats all up to you, but it gives you a straight forward mapping to work with remote data easier.</p>

<p>The first step in working with FDWs is getting them setup. I wrote an earlier post on how to do this manually. And if you&rsquo;re on Heroku theres an even easier solution if you want to setup a mapping entirely from one DB to another. The <a href="">pg-extras CLI plugin</a> has a command <code>fdwsql</code> which will generate the SQL to map all the tables for you. To run it simply specify the prefix app and database:</p>

<pre><code>heroku pg:fdwsql yourprefix APP::DATABASE_URL
</code></pre>

<p>This will generate a lot of SQL. From here you&rsquo;ll want to connect to the database where you want those foreign tables to be visible. Then run all the SQL. This will create all the foreign tables, this will mostly look just like another view or table to you in <code>\d</code>.</p>

<h3>Tips on working with them</h3>

<p>For the most part you can work with your foreign tables just like any other view or table. You can insert into them, read from them, join against them. Though currently foreign tables have some performance limitations, such as when joining it may return a lot more data than you expect then join. To make your performance a bit more ideal you can follow a few basic principles.</p>

<p>Lets look at some example tables to highlight this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; \d 
 users
 todos
</code></pre>

<p>In this case users is local and the todos are a foreign table. Looking at each of the schemas we have something like you might expect:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; \d users
                   Table "public.users"
    Column    |            Type             | Modifiers
 -------------+-----------------------------+-----------
  id          | integer                     | not null
  email       | text                        |
  created_at  | timestamp without time zone |
 Indexes:
     "users_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)
     "users_created" btree (created_at)


&gt; \d todo
               Foreign Table "public.todo"
    Column    |            Type             | Modifiers
 -------------+-----------------------------+-----------
  id          | integer                     | not null
  user_id     | integer                     |
  desc        | text                        |
  created_at  | timestamp without time zone |
  status      | boolean                     |
 Indexes:
     "users_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)
     "todo_created" btree (created_at)
</code></pre>

			The Best Postgres Feature You&#8217;re Not Using – CTEs Aka WITH Clauses</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>SQL by default isn&rsquo;t typically friendly to dive into, and especially so if you&rsquo;re reading someone else&rsquo;s already created queries. For some reason most people throw out principles we follow in other languages <a href="http://www.craigkerstiens.com/2013/07/29/documenting-your-postgres-database/">such as commenting</a> and composability just for SQL. I was recently reminded of a key feature in Postgres that most don&rsquo;t use by <a href="http://www.twitter.com/timonk">@timonk</a> highlighting it in his AWS Re:Invent Redshift talk. The simple feature actually makes SQL both readable and composable, and even for my own queries capable of coming back to them months later and understanding them, where previously they would not be.</p>

<p>The feature itself is known as CTEs or common table expressions, you may also here it referred to as <code>WITH</code> clauses. The general idea is that it allows you to create something somewhat equivilant to a view that only exists during that transaction. You can create multiple of these which then allow for clear building blocks and make it simple to follow what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
