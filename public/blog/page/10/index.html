<div id="_mcePaste">To give some background there is currently some selling going on, as the case often is with selling you sell the next version of what you&#8217;ll have. Or really sell what you think customers want, and that gives you validation if you should build it or not. I&#8217;m generally quite happy with this process, assuming you&#8217;ll have some time to test the market out, then build it. In fact this is the way a lot of businesses proceed and is a valid process. My problem isn&#8217;t with this process, it&#8217;s that I was told that we have to deviate from this process due to time constraints.</div>

		<p>The web is becoming saturated. It&rsquo;s no longer the pimply faced 20 somethings living in their mom&rsquo;s basements that are the key users and the source of most of the traffic on the web. Now you have communities for pregnant moms, sites for elderly widows looking to date, and social sites for kids from the time they&rsquo;re able to talk. So now that the web is hitting its saturation point of types of people interacting it becomes a critical issue to take advantage of those users and get them to do more.</p>

			Behavioral Targeting Versus Contextual Advertising</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There&rsquo;s a continual shift that seems to be happening on whether contextual advertising is better than behavioral. It seems that most people are becoming bigger and bigger on behavioral, and assuming that contextual has reached it&rsquo;s peak. After meeting with a company that at first started to do both, blurring the lines, taking advantage of each when they had appropriate data it started to become clear that they more so have their place and time. Behavioral and Contextual shouldn&rsquo;t be direct competitors.</p>

			Does Authenticity Matter?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">I&#8217;ve thought for some considerable time now about Twitter and how I feel it actually has more value than facebook with regards to advertising. The difference is context. However, I want to take a moment to look at it from a different angle. There is another key factor that drives the value of the network and the way you can monetize it, The authenticity of the network.</div>


<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Facebook is as authentic of a network as you can have, you have you, you are you, you&#8217;re not FunChick21, or MotorcycleGuy42, You&#8217;re Craig Kerstiens. You have a birthdate, which is likely you&#8217;re birthdate, you have a job that is your job, you have friends that are you&#8217;re friends. Facebook is probably as close to a virtual representation of your true life as you can get on a social network.</div>


<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Then you have Twitter. Twitter is probably as inauthentic as they come. You ARE FunChick21 or MotorcycleGuy42. You have that name, and that&#8217;s it. You have friends, but they&#8217;re up to you, it&#8217;s a one way relationship, not confirmation of friendship. For that reason you have 1,000,000 people following Ashton Kutcher, and he follows under 100. You&#8217;re friends could be celebrities, they could be friends, they could be random people that you liked their tweets.</div>


<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Facebook from an ad perspective I know almost everything I could want to about you from an ad targeting perspective. Few sites could give much more demographic info that I&#8217;d want to target effectively. Twitter I have next to nothing, I have a user name, and the content of what you say.</div>


<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">So there&#8217;s an advantage to facebook. But then you have the context of what I&#8217;m trying to do. If you&#8217;re facebook, you have users engaged in the site not wanting to leave. If you&#8217;re Twitter you have users that won&#8217;t be on the site for beyond 60 seconds. Getting them to leave shouldn&#8217;t be an issue, which means if you can drive where they are leaving to it should work out well for you.</div>


<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">But there&#8217;s a final piece. It&#8217;s a heavily growing marketplace, that really neither of the major communities picks up on, and it&#8217;s virtual goods. Virtual goods exist in either form of network, but neither seems to take advantage, meanwhile it&#8217;s the entire basis behinds such communities as World of Warcraft. How will they start to roll into mainstream networks, that&#8217;s yet to be seen, but I&#8217;ll be curious if virtual goods can become dominant in authentic networks or if they&#8217;ll primarily reside in inauthentic networks as they do today.</div>


<p>I&rsquo;ve thought for some considerable time now about Twitter and how I feel it actually has more value than facebook with regards to advertising. The difference is context. However, I want to take a moment to look at it from a different angle. There is another key factor that drives the value of the network and the way you can monetize it, The authenticity of the network.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve done some recent advising for someone working on a site that&rsquo;s of a social nature. The site is intended in some form to motivate users, the initial thought on this was to define a lot of rules, and send automated messages to users. To me this approach felt very 1990&rsquo;s. So assuming that were true, then comes the question of how do you motivate users?

		<p>Three times in recent years I&rsquo;ve had to micromanage others. Though probably in the contrary form to what you would expect. Most people think of micromanagement as their manager wanting to know every detail about their day, and be involved in every minute task. In most cases this form of micromanagement is never received well. Generally my feelings are that if I have to micromanage you, you don&rsquo;t belong in the role you&rsquo;re in, though I suppose exception cases may exist.</p>

			Why the Enterprise Cant Reach Consumers</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Most of my working career has been in what many would call an enterprise environment. Corporate structure well in place at most of them and in those cases any development followed closely to a waterfall methodology. You laid out requirements strictly and then built to those requirements. You essentially had nothing to show until you got to the end product.</p>

<p>Having been in the valley for several years and interacting with some startups and in other settings, I&rsquo;ve seen a very opposite mindset. The &ldquo;release early, release often&rdquo; concept. First you never have clear requirements when dealing with anything a startup should be tackling, if it&rsquo;s a very clear easy to solve problem, then someone else will have already tackled it. If you&rsquo;re doing something new, which you should be you can&rsquo;t gauge how users react, until you actually have something in front of them.</p>

			How to Succeed in the Workplace? Go to Lunch!</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Something I learned very early on in my working career, not so much from my experiences but from observing the results of others, was to engage at a social level as early possible. This doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to take time after 5:00 to get to know someone, the best opportunity exists every single day during what you would already do, lunch! Everyone usually takes a break and eats lunch during the day, usually there&rsquo;s two groups in an office. Those that always go out, and those that bring their lunch or meet others for lunch or maybe even work through it. If you notice those in the first group in your office my guess it&rsquo;s usually easier for them to get things done, they&rsquo;re normally a little more in touch with things that are going on. Especially if you can manage to branch out a little and go outside of the people you work with every moment of the day.</p>

			Building Apps From the Echo Chamber</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;">A few days ago myself and another were providing our thoughts and insight into a mockup that someone had created for a product they&#8217;re working on. At my first glance I noticed it and said wow, that looks pretty awesome. It wasn&#8217;t until a few minutes in that someone else said, if we all like this, you&#8217;re probably doing something wrong. Meaning that, we&#8217;re tech geeks, we&#8217;re silicon valley to a T, we like control and power, we like having the ability to set notification levels for every friend we have, for every minute of the day. But middle-america doesn&#8217;t use those features, much less they don&#8217;t use any products that have those features.</p>


<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px;"></p>


<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;">This quickly got us back to the question, who are you targetting, is it middle-america house wives, silicon valley geeks, busy executives. In any application that should always be your starting point. I&#8217;ll likely have much more on this piece later, but jumping back to the echo chamber users.</p>


<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px;"></p>


<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;">Probably the easiest way to illustrate this is twitter vs. friendfeed. Robert Scoble has said many many times FriendFeed is so much better, so much more than twitter. The biggest problem is that I can&#8217;t explain friend feed to my mom. I can explain twitter and she gets it. She can log in to twitter and understand it. Friendfeed there&#8217;s far to much a user has to do to get comfortable with it.</p>


<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px;"></p>


<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;">Any new mainstream application that launches should do everything transparent to the user. In that the application should seem like it&#8217;s almost doing nothing, it should be magic under the covers. A user should have to search to find the ability to configure it, you should gather information on your user, and make assumptions on what they want. If you get it even 50% right you&#8217;re likely to retain and engage more users than allowing them the ability to configure exactly what they want.</p>
