It hasn&rsquo;t broken down due to Django only though, I&rsquo;ve seen it break down in Ruby (Rails), Java, .Net, take you&rsquo;re pick of language or framework.</p>

<p>The breakdown of this model is due to several things:</p>

			Securing Your Internal Organization With OpenID</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&rsquo;ve recently been amazed at the number of companies that are still using a VPN or other means to manage their apps/network. Not just large enterprisey companies, but small agile startups. I fully understand that it works, but 95% of these places are also using another key tool for access inside their company&hellip; <em>Google Apps</em>. I fully expect companies to use google apps, its more of the former that surprises me most. For a long time OpenID wasn&rsquo;t at a usable point, even today it still isn&rsquo;t without its faults. However, it does make for a much cleaner workflow once in place than having your users login to something with they&rsquo;re used to using elsewhere.</p>

<p>In our personal lives we use email as our keys to the kingdom. In fact I now almost refuse to sign up for any service that doesn&rsquo;t let me use oauth, so why should a work place be much different. So I inquired with a few companies to see if they were fine with securing things like documentation or wiki&rsquo;s being google auth, they indeed were. Yet they still seem to have users keep one more username and password for their VPN to be able to login to access internal docs/tools.</p>

		<p>I alluded in earlier posts of <a href="http://www.craigkerstiens.com/2011/11/02/how-heroku-works-teams-tools/">How Heroku Works</a> that we have talented engineers. In fact I would venture to say that there is not a weak link when it comes to our engineers at Heroku. Ensuring we have talented engineers makes it easier for us to find other talented engineers and maintains a level of quality in our product. This means we must be very careful about not diluting our pool of engineering talent, which is where our hiring process becomes especially key. By the time we hire a new employee, we know without a doubt they&rsquo;re a fit within our organization.</p>

<p><em>Our goal in hiring is seldom to fill a role, but more commonly to find more talented people share our goal (changing the world for developers).</em></p>

			Getting Started With Django</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>For those completely new to web development, Django is a web framework that makes it easier to build web applications with Python. For those that have some knowledge of other web frameworks and Django you may be able to fly through much of the following. Django is a slight modification on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">MVC</a> construct which views itself as a <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/faq/general/#django-appears-to-be-a-mvc-framework-but-you-call-the-controller-the-view-and-the-view-the-template-how-come-you-don-t-use-the-standard-names">MVT</a> Model, View, Template. Django views a website as a project and within it smaller apps are contained.</p>

<p>Earlier we installed Django into your virtual environment. If your environment is loaded we can get started with a Django project. First lets create the project:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>django-admin.py startproject myproject
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This should have created a directory for your project called myproject. Within the myproject folder you&rsquo;ll find some core files to every Django project.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>ls
</span><span class='line'>myproject venv
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>ls myproject
</span><span class='line'>manage.py myproject
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>ls myproject/myproject
</span><span class='line'>__init__.py   settings.py urls.py
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Let&rsquo;s examine a little of each of the files and what they&rsquo;re used for:</p>

<p><code>manage.py</code> &ndash; A management utility for interacting with your Django project. In addition to the default commands available which you see by running <code>python manage.py</code>, you can create custom commands (we&rsquo;ll get into that much later).
<code>settings.py</code> &ndash; This is the settings file for your application. Here you&rsquo;ll put various configuration and load things such as your database connection.
<code>urls.py</code> &ndash; This is the place to setup how your urls will work. You&rsquo;ll define a path for the url and then which code is to be executed when you visit that url.</p>

			Postgres&#8230; The Death of NoSQL</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>NoSQL has long been a trend that many have talked about. While there&rsquo;s a place for various key-value stores and tools such as memcache and redis, this will address most specifically how NoSQL is attempting to replace a traditional database. I&rsquo;ve long been a fan of postgres and in general traditional relational databases. In a broad sense traditional databases offer multiple things.</p>

<h2>RDMS</h2>

<h3>Data guarantees</h3>

<p>The current major SQL databases (SQL Server, Postgres, MySQL, Oracle) offer guarantees around your data that doesn&rsquo;t always exist with other systems. At a very high level this means when they say they have the data there&rsquo;s not a chance they&rsquo;ll loose it. When using something as a primary datastore this is always my first requirement. Data is a valuable commodity so keeping it around is obviously important. There are cases where exceptions exist (reporting applications are common here). The specific thing I always look for is that a system upholds the ACID properties. For a quick breakdown of these:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>A</em> is for atomic. In short it means no transaction can be partially completed, its all or nothing.</li>
<li><em>C</em> is for consistent. This means you go from one consistent state to another. Meaning things like cascades and constraints are upheld and can&rsquo;t be ignored for a period of time.</li>
<li><em>I</em> is for isolation. This means transactions don&rsquo;t get to interfere with each other.</li>
<li><em>D</em> is for durability. This means once the transactions there its not going anywhere.</li>
</ul>


<p>These basic principles make me feel pretty content with my data being safe. This doesn&rsquo;t include things like backups and replication, but rather is a baseline for me feeling safe with a system.</p>

<p><em>Here&rsquo;s a hint, many NoSQL solutions don&rsquo;t enforce these which is where they get speed from</em></p>

<h3>Consistent means for accessing data (SQL)</h3>

<p>Many people complain about SQL and while its not a perfect language it is a common standard for accessing data. There are idioms that exist in Oracle that do not in Postgres and ones that exist in MySQL that do not in SQL Server, but on the whole ANSI-SQL is a common standard. This means if you learn one in large part you learn another (from an application developers perspective). This means you have a broader people to pull from when you consider moving from one to another, and that skills are more portable. While Mongo may be growing, its in no way guaranteed to be around in 5 years, nor is CouchDB. In fact there have been many NoSQL databases that have come and gone:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tokyo Cabinent</li>
<li></li>
</ul>


<h2>Postgres</h2>

<p>So there&rsquo;s some shared things that make databases great, but in particular Postgres aims to be the single database capable of ushering in a death to NoSQL. While each item could easily be its own blog post hopefully the following calls out they key values and allows people to dive in deeper.</p>

<h3>HStore</h3>

<p>I strongly debated saving the best for last, but really just couldn&rsquo;t wait. If there&rsquo;s a single feature in Postgres that will kill NoSQL its HStore. HStore is a data-type that allows you to store a dictionary within postgres.</p>

<h3>Custom datatypes</h3>

<h3>PostGIS</h3>

<p>Location is all the buzz these days and more and more applications have some tough of location involved in them.</p>

			How Heroku Works - Maker&#8217;s Day</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In my earlier post on <a href="/2011/11/02/how-heroku-works-teams-tools/">Teams and Tools at Heroku</a>, I mentioned how we value engineers&#8217; time; their work has enabled us to build a great platform. As a result of what we&rsquo;ve built, we&rsquo;ve had great growth both of our platform and of our teams internally. With that growth inevitably comes different distractions on engineers&#8217; time. Despite how a manager may plan things, engineering work needs long periods of uninterrupted time. To ensure that no matter what, an engineer has plenty of opportunity to do the work he or she was hired to do, Heroku has Maker&rsquo;s Day.</p>

			How Heroku Works - Dashboards</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Commonly these broader metrics are constantly visible. Heroku takes an approach that if a dashboard is visible and something looks bad its likely to get asked about and fixed. These aren&rsquo;t executive level dashboards about user count and revenue, instead its engineering focused like so much else of Heroku.</p>

<p>Because we love building a product for engineers, displayed publicly are the metrics engineers care about. Near the lunch table you&rsquo;ll find a persistent TV with average response time per request, tests that are passing, and requests per second across the platform.</p>

<p>Additionally individual dashboards exist on a per team basis. For example in The Vault (Heroku&rsquo;s payments and billings team), you&rsquo;ll find a screen constantly displaying recent test results and a quick view of percentages in the top right that relate to success versus failures for certain metrics.</p>

<p>The first problem I encountered is there was no way to access the HNSearch API directly from javascript. Sure you could write all of your code server side, but for many cases this may not be necessary.</p>

With this growth there&rsquo;s an increasing demand on individuals&#8217; time to interview candidates, ramp up new hires, collaborate cross organization&hellip; in short, individuals are putting in more time on procedural things. Many of those items, while very valuable, start to conflict with actually producing the code which at the end of the day is what we want engineers doing.
