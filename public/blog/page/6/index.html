			Rapid API Prototyping With Heroku Postgres Dataclips</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>For small and large applications there often comes a time where you&rsquo;re busy creating an API. The API creation process usually takes the form of something like: Design your API, Implement your API, Test and Evaluate, Rinse and Repeat. Historically with implementing the API fully you can&rsquo;t see how you truly feel about the result, causing this cycle to take longer than it should. Heroku Postgres has <a href="https://postgres.heroku.com/blog/past/2012/1/31/simple_data_sharing_with_data_clips/">Dataclips</a>, which (among other things) can be used for quickly prototyping APIs. <a href="https://postgres.heroku.com/dataclips">Dataclips</a> allows you to easily share data, but more importantly consume it in a form much like you would a restful API. Lets take a look at how this would work:</p>

<h2>Given a schema</h2>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/0n0k1h3q1I1W1T373q0D/1.%20psql.png" alt="schema" /></p>

<p>We can see from the screen shot of the schema above we can see we have a few tables. These tables are the complete works of Shakespeare thanks to <a href="http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/downloads/">opensourceshakespeare</a>. Lets take a couple of hypothetical endpoints we&rsquo;ve decided on that we&rsquo;d like to expose for users and test as an API.</p>

			Protips for Conference Talks</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A few weeks ago I was sitting at the hotel in Zurich with <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jacobian">Jacob Kaplan Moss</a> prior to <a href="http://klewel.com/conferences/djangocon-2012/">DjangoCon EU</a> enjoying a beer, talking about Django, and discussing a bit about our upcoming talks for the conference. He talked briefly about his upcoming <a href="http://klewel.com/conferences/djangocon-2012/index.php?talkID=2">keynote</a> and how he was doing something different, including essentially 5 mini-talks. This seemed interesting enough, but the part that surprised me was when Jacob said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m among friends here so it&rsquo;ll be a good place to test this format.&rdquo; Many if not all in the community know who Jacob is as one of the creators of Django, though still to be &ldquo;among friends&rdquo; at a roughly 300 person conference surprised me. However, as someone thats keynoted several times, spoken at conferences for many years, and familiar with many people in the community; for the 150-200 people there he had not met before, he was still truly among friends. While giving a keynote is never an easy feat, it seems to ease the worry ahead of time of doing such.</p>

<p>Saturday night there was a bit of conversation on twitter that had some related discussion. In the last minute rush for DjangoCon US talk submissions a few that have been involved in the community for some time discussed submitting their first talk proposals. In parallel to that was some discussion around diversity, I volunteered the idea of not including presenters name&rsquo;s in the list when reviewing and voting on talks. While both of the above are controversial topics alone, I hope that can be left to another later time. The key idea that emerged that can be helpful to anyone looking to submit a talk to a conference is how the &ldquo;pro&rsquo;s do it&rdquo;, as <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jdunck">Jeremy Dunck</a> put it.</p>

<p>So without further adieu, hopefully without speaking too much for him here&rsquo;s likely why Jacob viewed his 300 person keynote as being among friends:</p>

<h2>1. Start small</h2>

<p>Whether its practicing the talk itself or writing the abstract for a proposal practicing each step lets you refine this well ahead of time. In my experience, providing a talk description for a meetup can often be far harder than for a conference. For a meetup I feel confined to 2-3 sentences, versus an abstract a solid paragraph or two. Yet, I still have to make it as exciting, because of course I don&rsquo;t want 4 people to show up to the meetup because it sounds uninteresting. In the case I&rsquo;m most familiar with <a href="http://www.djangocon.us/">DjangoCon</a> and DjangoCon.eu both happen once a year, though many smaller regional conferences related to Python exist and especially meetup groups:</p>

			Schemaless Postgres in Django</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Earlier this week while I was at <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2012/djangocon-europe/">DjangoCon EU</a> there seemed to be a surprising amount of talk about MongoDB. My problem with this isn&rsquo;t with MongoDB, but in  the assumption that only Mongo can solve what you&rsquo;re looking for. By and far the most common feature is people want schemaless. It gives them flexibility in their data model and lets them iterate quickly. While I still opt for relational models that map cleanly to a relational database, there are cases where developers may want schemaless. I gave a quick lightning talk on this with slides <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/u/craigkerstiens/p/django-and-hstore">here</a>, but it is worth recapping.</p>

<p>The example given by <a href="http://www.twitter.com/pydanny">pydanny</a> was a product catalog. You may have different items you want to store for a catalog. Lets take an example below:</p>

<pre><code>django_pony = {'name': 'Django Pony', 'rating': '5'}
pink_pony = {'name': 'Pink Pony', 'rating': '4', 'color': 'pink'}
</code></pre>

<p>In the case of a product catalog it could be understandable you don&rsquo;t want to normalize every possible spec for the product. The argument for Mongo is so commonly that you can easily work with this data model. Admittedly it is quite simple:</p>

<pre><code>from pymongo import Connection
connection = Connection()
django_pony = {'name': 'Django Pony', 'rating': '5'}
connection.product.insert(django_pony)
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that this assumes other schemaless options don&rsquo;t exist or are inferior.</p>

<h2>Enter hStore</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/static/hstore.html">hStore</a> is a column type within Postgres. It is a key value store that allows you to store a dictionary, with text values. It alone is not a full document store replacement, but allows for flexibility in your data model where you need it while letting you use relational models elsewhere. Its not exactly new within Postgres either, as its been available since 8.4, however its recently become easier to work with and is supported in some form or another by more frameworks.</p>

<p>To do the same as above we only need to do a few steps:</p>

			Why PostgreSQL Part 2</a>
	</h2>

		<p><em>This post is a list of many of the reasons to use Postgres, much this content as well as how to use these features will later be curated within <a href="http://www.postgresguide.com">PostgresGuide.com</a>. If you need to get started check out <a href="http://postgresapp.com">Postgres.app</a> for Mac, or get a Cloud instance at <a href="https://postgres.heroku.com/?utm_source=referral&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=craigkerstiens">Heroku Postgres</a> for free</em></p>

<p>Last week I did a post on the <a href="/2012/04/30/why-postgres/">many reasons to use Postgres</a>. My goal with the post was two fold:</p>

<ul>
<li>Call out some of the historical arguments against it that don&rsquo;t hold any more</li>
<li>Highlight some of the awesome but more unique features that are less commonly found in databases.</li>
</ul>


<p>Once I published the post it was clear and was immediately pointed out in the comments and on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3910743">hacker news</a> that I missed quite a few features that I&rsquo;d mostly come to take for granted. <em>Perhaps this is due to so much awesomeness existing within Postgres.</em> A large thanks to everyone for calling these out. To help consolidate many of these, here&rsquo;s a second list of the many reasons to use PostgreSQL:</p>

<h2>Create Index Concurrently</h2>

<p>On most traditional databases when you create an index it holds a lock on the table while it creates the index. This means that the table is more or less useless during that time. When you&rsquo;re starting out this isn&rsquo;t a problem, but as your data grows and you then add indexes later to improve performance it could mean downtime just to add an index. Not surprisingly Postgres has a great means of adding an index without holding that lock. Simply doing <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/sql-createindex.html#SQL-CREATEINDEX-CONCURRENTLY"><code>CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY</code></a> instead of <code>CREATE INDEX</code> will create your index without holding the lock.</p>

<p><em>Of course with many features there are caveats, in the case of creating your index concurrently it does take somewhere on the order of 2-3 times longer, and cannot be done within a transaction</em></p>

<h2>Transactional DDL</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever run a migration had something break mid-way, either due to a constraint or some other means you understand what pain can come of quickly untangling such. Typically migrations on a schema are intended to be run holistically and if they fail you want to fully rollback. Some other databases such as Oracle in recent versions and SQL server do support, this. And of course Postgres supports wrapping your DDL inside a transaction. This means if an error does occur you can simply rollback and have the previous DDL statements rolled back with it, leaving your schema migrations as safe as your data, and your application in a consistent state.</p>

<h2>Foreign Data Wrappers</h2>

<p>I talked before about other languages within your database such as Ruby or Python, but what if you wanted to talk to other databases from your database. Postgres&rsquo;s Foreign Data Wrapper allows you to fully wrap external data systems and join on them in a similar fashion to as if they existed locally within the database. Here&rsquo;s a sampling of just a few of the foreign data wrappers that exist:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://pgxn.org/dist/oracle_fdw/">Oracle</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pgxn.org/dist/mysql_fdw/">MySQL</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pgxn.org/dist/redis_fdw/">Redis</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pgxn.org/dist/twitter_fdw/">Twitter</a></li>
</ul>


<p>In fact you can even use <a href="http://multicorn.org/">Multicorn</a> to allow you to write other foreign data wrappers in Python. An example of how this can be done, in this case with Database.com/Force.com can be found <a href="http://blog.database.com/blog/2011/11/21/a-database-comforce-com-foreign-data-wrapper-for-postgresql/">here</a></p>

<p><em>UPDATE: A <a href="/2012/05/07/why-postgres-part-2/">part 2</a> has been posted on <a href="/2012/05/07/why-postgres-part-2/">Why Use Postgres</a></em></p>

<p>Very often recently I find myself explaining why Postgres is so great. In an effort to save myself a bit of time in repeating this, I though it best to consolidate why Postgres is so great and dispel some of the historical arguments against it.</p>

<h2>Replication</h2>

<p>For some time the biggest argument for MySQL over Postgres was the lack of a good replication story for Postgres. With the release of <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/static/high-availability.html">8.4 Postgres&rsquo;s</a> story around replication quickly became much better.</p>

<p><em>While replication is indeed very important, are users actually setting up replication each time with MySQL or is it to only have the option later?</em></p>

<h2>Window functions</h2>

<p>This is a feature those familiar with Oracle greatly missed in Postgres. In fact even SQL Server had some form of them, though it was with T-SQL, which adds a bit more complexity to the feature. This is a feature that once you have you can&rsquo;t live without; the other options that existed before were slower and much more complicated. With the release of <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/tutorial-window.html">8.4</a> window functions were added to bring Postgres on par with Oracle in this area. For more info on using them check the Postgres docs above or <a href="http://postgresguide.com/tips/window.html">PostgresGuide.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Flexible Datatypes</h2>

<p>Creating a custom column is simpler in Postgres than any other database I&rsquo;ve used by far. Excluding custom datatypes, even Postgres&rsquo;s out of the box datatypes make Postgres stand out far ahead of other databases. In particular the ability to create a column as an <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/arrays.html">Array</a> of some datatype. Want to store a game of tic-tac-toe in a database, or an array of 1 user&rsquo;s phone numbers? It simply becomes a single column that can contain multiple phone numbers for a user.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been a user off and on depending on my needs for nearly four years since discovering it, and throughout that time all of the above have remained true. However, as I&rsquo;ve worked on and encountered more complex applications there&rsquo;s one thing that has time and again broke down for me, which is the Django apps model. It hasn&rsquo;t broken down due to Django only though, I&rsquo;ve seen it break down in Ruby (Rails), Java, .Net, take you&rsquo;re pick of language or framework.</p>

<p>The breakdown of this model is due to several things:</p>

			Securing Your Internal Organization With OpenID</a>
	</h2>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve recently been amazed at the number of companies that are still using a VPN or other means to manage their apps/network. Not just large enterprisey companies, but small agile startups. I fully understand that it works, but 95% of these places are also using another key tool for access inside their company&hellip; <em>Google Apps</em>. I fully expect companies to use google apps, its more of the former that surprises me most. For a long time OpenID wasn&rsquo;t at a usable point, even today it still isn&rsquo;t without its faults. However, it does make for a much cleaner workflow once in place than having your users login to something with they&rsquo;re used to using elsewhere.</p>

<p>In our personal lives we use email as our keys to the kingdom. In fact I now almost refuse to sign up for any service that doesn&rsquo;t let me use oauth, so why should a work place be much different. So I inquired with a few companies to see if they were fine with securing things like documentation or wiki&rsquo;s being google auth, they indeed were. Yet they still seem to have users keep one more username and password for their VPN to be able to login to access internal docs/tools.</p>

			How Heroku Works - Hiring</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I alluded in earlier posts of <a href="http://www.craigkerstiens.com/2011/11/02/how-heroku-works-teams-tools/">How Heroku Works</a> that we have talented engineers. In fact I would venture to say that there is not a weak link when it comes to our engineers at Heroku. Ensuring we have talented engineers makes it easier for us to find other talented engineers and maintains a level of quality in our product. This means we must be very careful about not diluting our pool of engineering talent, which is where our hiring process becomes especially key. By the time we hire a new employee, we know without a doubt they&rsquo;re a fit within our organization.</p>

<p><em>Our goal in hiring is seldom to fill a role, but more commonly to find more talented people share our goal (changing the world for developers).</em></p>
