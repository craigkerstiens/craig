<h3>It all starts with stats</h3>

<p>I wrote about some of the <a href="https://postgres.heroku.com/blog/past/2012/12/6/postgres_92_now_available/">great new features in Postgres 9.2</a> in the recent announcement on support of Postgres 9.2 on <a href="https://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a>. One of those awesome features, is <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/pgstatstatements.html">pg_stat_statements</a>. Its not commonly known how much information Postgres keeps about your database (beyond the data of course), but in reality it keeps a great deal. Ranging from basic stuff like table size to cardinality of joins to distribution of indexes, and with pg_stat_statments it keeps a normalized record of when queries are run.</p>

		<p><em>Update as of 8/2/2016 &ndash; As a follow-up if you&rsquo;re using Postgres and looking to shard your data I would encourage you taking a look at <a href="https://www.citusdata.com">Citus</a>. Citus is an extension to Postgres that makes easy for you to shard your data and allow you to continue to scale out memory or processing power. Disclaimer: I currently run Citus Cloud, a fully managed hosted offering of Citus on top of AWS</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m increasingly encountering users on <a href="http://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a> that are encountering the need to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shard_(database_architecture)">shard</a> their data. For most users this is something you delay as long as possible as you can generally go for sometime before you have to worry about it. Additionally scaling up your database is often a reasonable approach early on and something I encourage as a starting point as scaling up is easy to do with regards to databases. However, for the 1% of users that do need to shard when the time comes many are left wondering where to start, hence the following guide.</p>

		<p>A few weeks back I did a brief <a href="/2012/08/20/arrays-in-postgres/">feature highlight on Postgres arrays</a>. Since that time I&rsquo;ve found myself using them with increasing regularity on small side projects. Much of this time I&rsquo;m using Django and of course not opting to write raw SQL to be able to use arrays. Django actually makes it quite simple to work with Arrays in Postgres with a package by <a href="http://www.niwi.be/about.html">Andrey Antukh</a>. Lets get started by installing two libraries:</p>

<pre><code>pip install djorm-ext-pgarray
pip install djorm-ext-expressions
</code></pre>

<p>The first library is for support for the array field type, the second allows us to more easily mix bits of SQL within the Django ORM.</p>

			Redis in My Postgres</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Yesterday there was a post which hit <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4664178">Hacker News</a> that talked about using <a href="http://www.citusdata.com/blog/51-run-sql-on-mongodb">SQL to access Mongo</a>. While this is powerful I think much of the true value was entirely missed within the post.</p>

<p>SQL is an expressive language, though people are often okay with accessing Mongo data through its own ORM. The real value is that you could actually query the data from within Postgres then join across your data stores, without having to do some ETL process to move data around.  Think&hellip; joining sales data from Postgres with user reviews stored in Mongo or searching for visits to a website (retained in redis) against purchases by user in Postgres.</p>

<p>The mechanism pointed out was a MongoDB Foreign Data Wrapper. A Foreign Data Wrapper or FDW essentially lets you connect to an external datastore from within a Postgres database. In addition to the Mongo FDW released the other day there&rsquo;s  many others. For example Postgres 9.0 and up ships with one called <code>db_link</code>, which lets you query and join across two different Postgres databases. Beyond that there&rsquo;s support for a variety of other data stores including some you may have never expected:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://pgxn.org/dist/redis_fdw/">Redis</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pgxn.org/dist/file_textarray_fdw/">Textfile</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pgxn.org/dist/mysql_fdw/">MySQL</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pgxn.org/dist/oracle_fdw/">Oracle</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pgxn.org/dist/odbc_fdw/">ODBC</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pgxn.org/dist/ldap_fdw/">LDAP</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pgxn.org/dist/twitter_fdw/">Twitter</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pgxn.org/tag/fdw/">More</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Lets look at actually getting the Redis one running then see what some of the power of it really looks like. First we have to get the code then build it:</p>

		<p><em>Update theres a more <a href="/2013/01/10/more-on-postgres-performance/">recent post that expands further on where to start optimizing</a> specific queries, and of course if you want to dig into optimizing your infrastructure <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/184951030X?tag=mypred-20">High Performance PostgreSQL is still a great read</a></em></p>

<p>For many application developers their database is a black box. Data goes in, comes back out and in between there developers hope its a pretty short time span. Without becoming a DBA there&rsquo;s a few pieces of data that most application developers can easily grok which will help them understand if their database is performing adequately. This post will provide some quick tips that allow you to determine whether your database performance is slowing down your app, and if so what you can do about it.</p>

<h3>Understanding your Cache and its Hit Rate</h3>

<p>The typical rule for most applications is that only a fraction of its data is regularly accessed. As with many other things data can tend to follow the 80/20 rule with 20% of your data accounting for 80% of the reads and often times its higher than this. Postgres itself actually tracks access patterns of your data and will on its own keep frequently accessed data in cache. Generally you want your database to have a cache hit rate of about 99%. You can find your cache hit rate with:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
  sum(heap_blks_read) as heap_read,
  sum(heap_blks_hit)  as heap_hit,
  sum(heap_blks_hit) / (sum(heap_blks_hit) + sum(heap_blks_read)) as ratio
FROM 
  pg_statio_user_tables;
</code></pre>

			Arrays in Postgres</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Postgres out of the box has an abundance of datatypes, from standard <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/datatype.html#DATATYPE-NUMERIC">numeric datatypes</a> to <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/datatype-geometric.html">geometric</a> or even <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/datatype-net-types.html">network datatypes</a>. With extensions you can get even more out of it as earlier discussed with <a href="http://craigkerstiens.com/2012/06/11/schemaless-django/">hStore</a>. Though with all of the datatypes its easy to miss out on some of them that are there, in fact one of my favorites is often missed entirely. The <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/arrays.html">Array</a> datatype lets you do just as you&rsquo;d expect, store an array inside Postgres. With this you can often get some of the functionality you&rsquo;d want in a single table when you might traditionally have expanded to multiple tables.</p>

<p>The broader question may be why you&rsquo;d actually want to use an array. One good reason may be if you&rsquo;re an application developer its how you think of your data, so why not model it the same way. As you&rsquo;ll see below it can be easier than joining and aggregating across a set of rows. Also depending on your case you performance could be improved, though mileage may vary here as it does depend on the data you&rsquo;re storing.</p>

<p>First a bit of a hacky example&hellip; Lets say you have a basic website that sells stuff, and instead of having a purchase ID and a total you want to include the quantity, id, and price of each item in a single row. With a bit of a messy foreign key (using a decimal) you could store all of this within a single row:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE purchases (
    id integer NOT NULL,
    user_id integer,
    items decimal(10,2) [100][1],
    occurred_at timestamp
);
</code></pre>

<p>With this table I could have an array that holds multiple records of:</p>

<ul>
<li>The item purchased</li>
<li>The quantity</li>
<li>The price</li>
</ul>

			Rapid API Prototyping With Heroku Postgres Dataclips</a>

		<p>For small and large applications there often comes a time where you&rsquo;re busy creating an API. The API creation process usually takes the form of something like: Design your API, Implement your API, Test and Evaluate, Rinse and Repeat. Often you&rsquo;re unable to tell how you truly feel about your API without fully implementing it, causing this cycle to take longer than it should. Heroku Postgres has Dataclips, which (among other things) can be used for quickly prototyping APIs. Lets take a look at how this would work:</p>

			Protips for Conference Talks</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A few weeks ago I was sitting at the hotel in Zurich with <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jacobian">Jacob Kaplan Moss</a> prior to <a href="http://klewel.com/conferences/djangocon-2012/">DjangoCon EU</a> enjoying a beer, talking about Django, and discussing a bit about our upcoming talks for the conference. He talked briefly about his upcoming <a href="http://klewel.com/conferences/djangocon-2012/index.php?talkID=2">keynote</a> and how he was doing something different, including essentially 5 mini-talks. This seemed interesting enough, but the part that surprised me was when Jacob said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m among friends here so it&rsquo;ll be a good place to test this format.&rdquo; Many if not all in the community know who Jacob is as one of the creators of Django, though still to be &ldquo;among friends&rdquo; at a roughly 300 person conference surprised me. However, as someone thats keynoted several times, spoken at conferences for many years, and familiar with many people in the community; for the 150-200 people there he had not met before, he was still truly among friends. While giving a keynote is never an easy feat, it seems to ease the worry ahead of time of doing such.</p>

<p>Saturday night there was a bit of conversation on twitter that had some related discussion. In the last minute rush for DjangoCon US talk submissions a few that have been involved in the community for some time discussed submitting their first talk proposals. In parallel to that was some discussion around diversity, I volunteered the idea of not including presenters name&rsquo;s in the list when reviewing and voting on talks. While both of the above are controversial topics alone, I hope that can be left to another later time. The key idea that emerged that can be helpful to anyone looking to submit a talk to a conference is how the &ldquo;pro&rsquo;s do it&rdquo;, as <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jdunck">Jeremy Dunck</a> put it.</p>

<p>So without further adieu, hopefully without speaking too much for him here&rsquo;s likely why Jacob viewed his 300 person keynote as being among friends:</p>

<h2>1. Start small</h2>

<p>Whether its practicing the talk itself or writing the abstract for a proposal practicing each step lets you refine this well ahead of time. In my experience, providing a talk description for a meetup can often be far harder than for a conference. For a meetup I feel confined to 2-3 sentences, versus an abstract a solid paragraph or two. Yet, I still have to make it as exciting, because of course I don&rsquo;t want 4 people to show up to the meetup because it sounds uninteresting. In the case I&rsquo;m most familiar with <a href="http://www.djangocon.us/">DjangoCon</a> and DjangoCon.eu both happen once a year, though many smaller regional conferences related to Python exist and especially meetup groups:</p>
