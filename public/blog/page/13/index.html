			Site Review: Friendfeed</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There&rsquo;s been a lot of buzz in the valley lately around this very small startup, that has a few pretty heavy hitters. Between the four founders they have worked on nearly all of the Google products so many know and love, with the exception of search. <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/paul-buchheit">Paul Bucheit</a>, is even responsible for Google&rsquo;s current motto, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be evil&rdquo;. These four guys not only are visionaries within the web space, they also know how to deliver a product, having helped build and scale gmail and google maps is indeed a noteworthy accomplishment.</p>

<p>But what about their current task at hand, to be <a href="http://craigekerstiens.com/?p=12">web 3.0</a> and r<a href="http://craigekerstiens.com/?p=12">educe the noise of all of the web 2.0</a> tools out there. Well, first let me summarize what friendfeed does. When you sign up for friendfeed you add your web 2.0 accounts (currently supporting 35), some of note are: facebook, google talk, iLike, digg, twitter, flickr, picasa, youtube, yelp, and others. <a href="http://friendfeed.com/">Friendfeed </a>then creates a feed of you, so you can send the link to anyone and they can have a single source for updates to all of your web 2.0 interactions. <a href="http://friendfeed.com/">Friendfeed </a>does do a little more than that though, they attempt to filter out some of the noise by grouping your interactions together. For someone like Robert Scoble that on a given day could post 1000 tweets, you likely don&rsquo;t want to see each one as a single line item. Friendfeed will group these and give you a short preview, then allow you to drill down.</p>

<p>All-in-all <a href="http://friendfeed.com/">friendfeed </a>is a reasonable service and will continue to be talked about in the valley for the coming year and then spread elsewhere in the world. However there are some problems with the service. First is the lag time, due to the restrictions of some of the services they connect to, sometimes your feed is twenty minutes behind your original posts/updates. Though this is no fault of their own, but nonetheless something users will not be excited over.</p>

<p>But more importantly <a href="http://friendfeed.com/">friendfeed </a>doesn&rsquo;t have a concept of context. This would be my number one complaint that they&rsquo;re not approaching web 3.0 yet. My most likely favorite site (well second to <a href="http://www.twitter.com">twitter</a>), which will be reviewed next week, does a great job of understanding you and your context. When it recommends something it&rsquo;s doing based on your history and it&rsquo;s knowledge of you, and its often right. Indeed grouping messages together does have value, but until it can show me the messages I <strong>want</strong> to see and hide the ones I do not I won&rsquo;t be amazed.</p>

<p>Whether or not you should be on it strictly depends on your involvement in web 2.0 sites. If you&rsquo;re on more than 5 of the sites listed in their 35, it may be a worthwhile investment. While it won&rsquo;t make the noise quiet, it will likely reduce it by 10-20%, which is better than nothing.</p>

<p>Other sites to watch out for (if they ever release): <a href="http://socialthing.com/">socialthing </a></p>

			iPhone 1.1</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>So this week they announced what many expected was coming the iPhone 3g. However off the shelf it&rsquo;s still not webÂ  2.0, while a great device its not a web 2.0 device yet. Apple without a doubt understands user experience, but they do not fully grasp web 2.0 yet. Microsoft seems to even have a better understanding with the products they are looking to role out with Mesh and their enterprise social/collaboration tools. Lot&rsquo;s of great applications were highlighted at the keynote, but only one of those talking about publishing content (with the exception of mobileme, which is a paid service). While there&rsquo;s no doubt I will be getting the new iPhone when it is released in July, I will not talk about how it is a great web 2.0 device.</p>

<p>If the application store is as open as Apple alludes to it being, then I can see how it will quickly become a web 2.0 device. Loopt is likely the strongest contender for helping to build a location based social network, and when they release for the iPhone can turn it into a web 2.0 device. I&rsquo;ll be most anxious to see how the push based services they announced will help to allow developers to turn it into a web 2.0 device as well. If I had to have my application constantly up it just doesn&rsquo;t work out as a full enabler for web 2.0. BUT if you allow notifications to be regularly pushed it just simplifies and increases the regularity of community and people staying in touch.</p>

<p>The tipping point though for me at least will be if or when Apple finally allows video on the video. No, not playing video, but recording and streaming video. The kind of abilities available on a nokia n95, or available in my apple computer through iChat. When I can pull my phone out of my pocket and display to the world what I&rsquo;m doing or where I&rsquo;m at, you will have a device that allows you to communicate and most of all collaborate like any other before. It doesnt require more power than is already there, in fact I can record video on my jailbroken phone right now. The nokia n95 does a great job of streaming live video to qik, which is how I watched much of the Apple Keynote, it simply takes Apple finally understanding web 2.0 and embracing it.</p>

			How Not to Be Successful in the Valley</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>While I may or may not know how to be successful in silicon valley, I feel pretty confident that I can point out a few ways to not be successful in valley terms. What follows is my thoughts on how you can best limit yourself to own, run, or be involved in the entrepreneurial spirit of the valley.</p>

<p>The first is keeping yourself in a bubble, by not diving into the new technologies, new services, and new age of the web there&rsquo;s little possibility you can be at the next steps of it. While I concede you don&rsquo;t always have to explain it or understand it, you at least need to <strong>use it</strong>. The prestigious attitude of standing against something just for the sake of it won&rsquo;t get you very far when people attempt to find you and communicate and can&rsquo;t. There will be few individuals in the future similar to Jobs and Ellison that are a box of mysteries that no one has access to. Instead you will simply filter out noise that is relevant, but regardless your presence will be felt. It&rsquo;s not only about making your life easier with useful tools like mint or dropbox and thinking about the next useful utility, but also about communicating and relating to others. Final thought &hellip; facebook be on it, twitter use it (don&rsquo;t understand it, don&rsquo;t explain it, just use it), friendfeed (jury&rsquo;s out, but you better know what it is).</p>

<p>The second biggest thing you can do is to be patient. So many seem to sit around, wanting to have their own big thing, but are waiting for that one great idea to come to them. In most cases something probably does, the only problem is they&rsquo;re not seasoned or practiced at building something. Yeah a few get lucky on the first try, but as a whole for those that are successful its due to persistence and not patience. Waiting for the right time in the market, the right time in your life, or just the right idea is wasting time you can&rsquo;t get back. If you truly want to run something, start running something, and when the right idea does finally come along you&rsquo;ll be prepared to build it up and run with it.</p>

<p>Third thing you can do is not to network. Yeah it&rsquo;s easier than before to build a product and get people to adopt it because of the web, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you can do it on your own. If you want to have a great idea with a lot of potential go to waste, sit at home on a Friday night, work away alone and you will have no worries about having too much traffic or too many users. Most likely your idea will only appeal to you and miss various features and miss the needs of some of the users that would have been happy to tell you what they wanted.</p>

<p>Fourth, spend all your time networking. So you go to the events, meet the people, know people to fund you, have a great idea, and finally decide you&rsquo;re going to actually start working on a product. The same night you sit down to code, you read of your product launching with someone else. With less funding, less knowledge, and less experience, all because they&rsquo;ve actually been working on it. It&rsquo;s a fine balance, but err on the side of not having <strong>every</strong> connection that you will need for a successful launch, and instead having a working demo or product to show to the connections that you do have.</p>

			The Value in Content as a Commodity</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There was a recent post over at <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/content_is_becoming_a_commodity.php">ReadWriteWeb</a> about how content is becoming a commodity. I don&rsquo;t believe many people would argue with this. While at first this wasn&rsquo;t something I viewed in a positive light the more I think over it the more I see some value in it. As content does become more and more of a commodity the value in who is publishing or producing that content goes up. Five years ago if someone would have talked about some trade-secret they learned about from Google many people would have perked up and listened. Today however rumors spread faster than ever and before you know it google calendars now predicts when your appointments are, puts them in your calendar, and sends you text messages with directions 30 minutes before each meeting. While this may very well happen some day, I&rsquo;m pretty sure they won&rsquo;t be rolling it out next week.</p>

<p>Now with so much content being produced and spread all over the place there is still some value in the quality of content (which there always has been). However, now there is much heavier focus on the source it came from. This comes to the principle of branding, and not necessarily like a wal-mart or coke brand, but a personal branding. My guess is that in the future, and by future I mean sooner than later (likely 2-3 years), personal brands as a whole will carry more weight than the companies they work for.</p>

<p>Take for example <a href="http://www.digg.com">Digg</a>, when <a href="http://www.digg.com">Digg </a>makes some announcement or stance a few people listen and it does get noticed. But this is only when the content or opinion falls within the <a href="http://www.digg.com">Digg </a>world. Meanwhile when <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/kevin-rose">Kevin Rose</a> makes an announcement many more people than just in the realm of <a href="http://www.digg.com">Digg </a>notice. He&rsquo;s a prime example of someone that has built a personal brand, he&rsquo;s name carries weight, and more so than just that of <a href="http://www.digg.com">Digg</a>, <a href="http://www.pownce.com">Pownce</a>, or <a href="http://revision3.com/">Revision3 </a>(even though they are nearly one in the same).</p>

<p>Some might view content becoming a commodity as a bit of a blow. I believe we will see more individuals emerge with an understanding of personal branding in part to help us sort through the content, but also to provide quality content in repeatable manners.</p>

			Nearsighted Business</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Adobe&rsquo;s former CEO, Bruce Chizen, when asked &lsquo;What advice do you have for new/young public companies?&rsquo;, gave a response of &lsquo;Go private&rsquo;. While partially a joke he went on to elaborate something that many businesses seem to miss on. The main idea is that businesses are very nearsighted in their focus, they look at quarterly goals and in some cases yearly, but not where they want to be in 10 years. When companies become worried that head count is high they simply freeze hiring across the board without thinking of its ramifications. Good people, well great people are truly hard to find, and when a company enforces a blanket hiring freeze they miss out on those few great people that they truly need to grow. Meanwhile when they decide they have bandwidth for 1000 new employees they open the flood gates and let the first 1000 that can spell their name correctly in, because they can. This short term focus in the long run greatly limits the ability of what a company can achieve.</p>

<p>In contrast a smaller company that is actually much more at risk of dying seems to have a better understanding of what their approach should be. While they may be understaffed and overworked, they firmly understand that they only have so many funds and therefore make wiser decisions when using them. The characteristics of the larger business and their short sighted focus leads to the cyclical performance that many experience over a few years, rather than a very steady growth they would like to maintain, and often leads to their end. A prime example would be IBM that laid off so many of their more talented people to lower their numbers years ago. As a result they lost their best workers and had many unexperienced individuals in there when they began hiring again. They are still working to catch back up to where they once were in the IT industry&hellip;</p>

<p>In part I wonder if being a private entity is really the only way to have the long term focus and not worry about quarterly earnings. Personally I have never been privy to this insight and may not be for some time, but I don&rsquo;t foresee shareholders being patient enough to not punish a company if earnings are not so hot for a year or even a few quarters. So there may be nothing a large business can do about it, but I am surprised that more do not try.</p>

			Blurring the Lines, the Flip Side</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>So yesterday I posted around blurring the lines around your personal and professional life. Today I&rsquo;d like to discuss a bit of the opposite of when companies blur the lines. Hopefully you don&rsquo;t, but at first you may think how is this possible. Well first let me highlight some of what many feel are negative pieces, such as when an HR Rep who went to the same university as you looks up your facebook profile. You thinking this is private to friends at school may not regularly monitor the content that goes up there. This specific case is a very interesting one, and for the moment I&rsquo;d like to stay clear of it.</p>

<p>Instead I&rsquo;d like to focus on some of the areas where businesses undoubtedly should improve, and some notable ones that are doing that very well. I first would like to take (as per my usual) an example from twitter. Twitter is many things for many people, but it is extremely common to find people on twitter ranting about a particular service. While I may complain all I want about <a href="http://twitter.com/comcastcares">Comcast </a>to my friends, they have little ability to do much to counteract this. But when I do it on <a href="http://www.twitter.com">twitter </a>they do, and <a href="http://twitter.com/comcastcares">Comcast </a>is one example of a company that is taking a very pro-active approach to managing their online presence. I take an example of a few months ago, when internet had been out at Michael Arrington&rsquo;s house, who is the founder of <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/04/06/comcast-twitter-and-the-chicken-trust-me-i-have-a-point/">TechCrunch</a>. He twittered about this outage, and had a personal phone call from an executive in Philadelphia a few hours later. Sure, he&rsquo;s a noticeable guy so they responded to him. To me the attention getter was when someone called comcast&rsquo;s bluff they they only follow the important people, and any old average joe doesn&rsquo;t get a response. That particular average old joe did, saying they make the best effort they can to reach out to everyone (<a href="http://twitter.com/HRBlock">HR Block</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/SouthwestAir">Southwest </a>are also doing this quite well).</p>

<p>The other is a little less about blurring the lines, but I still think a great example of a business stepping out of their traditional roles. This one was a story relayed to me by a co-worker. <a href="http://www.zappos.com">Zappos</a>, which is an online shoe company primarily, has a great return policy. In any case, if you don&rsquo;t like the shoe after you receive it, just return it, and they&rsquo;ll even pay for the shipping. This specific incident a woman&rsquo;s husband had recently passed away and she was attempting to return the shoes. She gave the reasoning behind it, and the customer service rep proceeded to go an extra step and send flowers to the funeral. While to some this might be offensive, or at the very least outside the bounds of a normal company, it shoes a company actually caring for people, which wasn&rsquo;t their core business. While I won&rsquo;t go into details of how well this turned out for the company, it&rsquo;s a great example of a company blurring the lines.</p>

<p>In the future I anticipate we will see more and more of companies doing this, actually caring about what someone says/thinks/feels not only about the company, but personally as well. As we get to this it will become less about the buck and more about meeting needs.</p>

			Mixing Personal and Professional, Transparency</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Someone recently commented on by tweeting after having given my two weeks notice to my company, that it may not have been the best idea. So as a result I&rsquo;d like to post my reasoning and thought why I feel it is actually a great idea. Even a month before my giving two weeks notice many knew it was likely going to happen, and I personally hope that this allowed those that may have needed to, to better plan accordingly. This also I believe allows me to be more evaluated on my actual merit in some terms. You see if I made it clear that I might be looking at another opportunity, and was not wanted I believe there may have been good reason hints would have been given that I should look harder and more. Instead in was a reasonable bit of the opposite.</p>

<p>However the larger point of what I&rsquo;d like to illustrate is that many of those that I work with I view as more than strictly co-workers. It&rsquo;s not uncommon to meet up with them on a Saturday for drinks or to just hang out. Meanwhile I have many friends who I do not talk to on a daily or even weekly basis, yet still like to keep them informed of what I&rsquo;m up to, just as I look to follow how they are. To me twitter and other social tools are this medium. While some may prefer to keep professional and personal strictly separate entities, I have no problem with the two blurring. In fact I believe it adds to what I bring to the table in both contexts. By no means do I live and breath work, but to me my work is not only a job either. There are times after 5 or 6 o&#8217;clock that I will spend reading about business and technology, in short because they interest me. Though there are times between 8 and 5, that I will have an IM conversation un-work related, or post tweets available to the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Hopefully some may value this transparency, though if you do not, dont add me on facebook, dont follow me on twitter. You&rsquo;ll still get the formal good-bye email with the rest of the group, however, I wouldn&rsquo;t expect you to get updates in 5 years, though that may be what you hope for. Personally I like to keep in touch with those that I enjoy working with, but also care to know about how they are doing with regards to their personal life. To me blurring the lines makes the relationships deeper and life more rewarding</p>

			Adobe Came to Play</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;ve said it before, but in case I haven&rsquo;t voiced it on here yet, watch out for Adobe. They look like they&rsquo;re firing on all cylinders lately and don&rsquo;t look to be slowing down. At Adobe MAX 2007, I saw a preview of many things that were coming up for them. Though from already having worked with Adobe Flex was a fan, at least of the Flex and AIR products. Adobe now seems to be doing as much to drive adoption of the products as they expect from developers.</p>

<p>First came the acquisition of Buzzword, which is a Flex based word application. With additional abilities for users to collaborate, which in my opinion were already slightly superior to Google&rsquo;s word equivalent. Then came Adobe Photoshop Express, this was in a sense a lighter version of Adobe Photoshop, only available online and best of all for <strong>free</strong>. While impressive in their own rights, they really just did a great job of showcasing the power of flex.</p>

<p>Now with acrobat.com adobe seems to have hit a home run. While it may only be a landing place for their in house web applications, it&rsquo;s a landing place that points to a lot of great tools. Namely adobe connect, which at least matches if not passes every virtual meeting tool I&rsquo;ve ever used. With well integrated white-boarding, screen sharing, file sharing, web cams, and dial-in support as well, it will surely be my choice for online meetings in the near future. Once the other tools such as buzzword and potentially other applications others such as google and microsoft will have to very much watch out.</p>

			Changing Etiquette?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A recent conversation of someone that was offended when the were introduced to someone new, then was not greeted first since they were a female brought what follows to mind. The above is a train of thought that came from a 70 year old military wife. I do not believe this is common practice today and is quite rarely found as the common etiquette, but nonetheless I think what is proper etiquette in business is changing quite rapidly. Though I&rsquo;m not sure if <strong>all</strong> of the older ideas and principles have gone away.</p>

<p>I take as a first example zuckerburg, whom is a notoriously difficult interview. Not because he keeps things hidden, or is sealed tight about the company, but rather that his soft skills are not his strength. His strength is building a web product that millions of people find worthwhile to divulge hours of their day into it.</p>

<p>Even two years ago when you were disgruntled with a company you may have gotten a few drinks in you and talked to a friend about your displeasure. But it certainly was not made fully public for anyone to see. At best you could only hope you were simply privy to things that would be brought to the publics eye from a larger misdoing either legally or that a mass-crowd found a problem with. But for simply being overworked, underpaid, or in some other odd way mistreated there was no politically correct outlet to speak through.</p>

<p>However in the past years it has become extremely common for those that are still employed, or were employed to voice their complaints and bring to light the details that were once hidden. I think of Zed Shaw&rsquo;s rant on rails which calls out specific companies, or an older blog the diary of a mac genius, who gave detailed behind the scenes information of an apple customer support genius bar. While I&rsquo;ll concede for the mass majority if it&rsquo;s published it&rsquo;s doesn&rsquo;t mean its consumed, so it&rsquo;s not a dramatic effect on any single business, I still find it hard to believe that this overall shift of users freely publishing is not going to be able to be stopped by companies. As we approach web 3.0 and have a better ability to pull in a larger base of information that&rsquo;s more relevant this information may become more and more helpful to users.</p>

<p>Regardless of the effects, it seems the standard procedures for what is proper etiquette are changing. Whether its talking about your place of employment, or HR checking out you&rsquo;re facebook profile to see if you&rsquo;d be a risk for the company, the lines are being blurred from both sides and the barriers that once existed are now being torn down.</p>

			Is Web 2.0 More Utopian?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I recently read an article on Techcrunch on how web 2.0 had undoubtedly made an impact, but had yet to truly make money. From my stance they is really one way to make money on the web, which is through advertising (paid subscription services are dying). This can either be done through a simple banner ad, or something that can more easily be deemed a qualified lead or referral. Ads will always be there, but if web 2.0 is to start making money it must be on improving the measurement and throughput of qualified leads.</p>

<p>Without going into too much detail on referrals and qualified leads I&rsquo;d like to mention a great example of this, mint.com. Mint offers a great free service of managing your personal finances. Throwing out security and sharing your data (another time another place), they do a great job of categorizing and monitoring your finances. In exchange they have access to your spending history. So you give them your spending history, in exchange that have hundreds of thousands of peoples data, such as what credit card you use, who your cable provider is. With this mint does what I believe is a good job of generating referrals, but telling you how much you can save by switching from Internet provider A at $60 per month to Internet provider B at $30 per month. They&rsquo;re not just giving ads for the sake of it, they&rsquo;re giving me something that I would actually want.</p>

<p>Does this lead to higher or lower revenue? We&rsquo;ll this I&rsquo;m not sure of, but with regards to advertising, feel this is a more better fit for a user. I only get things that the service provider thinks <strong>I want </strong>not what they <strong>think they can sell me</strong>. As we reach more of the semantic understanding of the web I believe this will prevail and make web 2.0 more profitable, but it cannot be done with web 2.0 alone.</p>
