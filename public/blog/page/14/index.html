			Blurring the Lines, the Flip Side</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>So yesterday I posted around blurring the lines around your personal and professional life. Today I&rsquo;d like to discuss a bit of the opposite of when companies blur the lines. Hopefully you don&rsquo;t, but at first you may think how is this possible. Well first let me highlight some of what many feel are negative pieces, such as when an HR Rep who went to the same university as you looks up your facebook profile. You thinking this is private to friends at school may not regularly monitor the content that goes up there. This specific case is a very interesting one, and for the moment I&rsquo;d like to stay clear of it.</p>

<p>Instead I&rsquo;d like to focus on some of the areas where businesses undoubtedly should improve, and some notable ones that are doing that very well. I first would like to take (as per my usual) an example from twitter. Twitter is many things for many people, but it is extremely common to find people on twitter ranting about a particular service. While I may complain all I want about <a href="http://twitter.com/comcastcares">Comcast </a>to my friends, they have little ability to do much to counteract this. But when I do it on <a href="http://www.twitter.com">twitter </a>they do, and <a href="http://twitter.com/comcastcares">Comcast </a>is one example of a company that is taking a very pro-active approach to managing their online presence. I take an example of a few months ago, when internet had been out at Michael Arrington&rsquo;s house, who is the founder of <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/04/06/comcast-twitter-and-the-chicken-trust-me-i-have-a-point/">TechCrunch</a>. He twittered about this outage, and had a personal phone call from an executive in Philadelphia a few hours later. Sure, he&rsquo;s a noticeable guy so they responded to him. To me the attention getter was when someone called comcast&rsquo;s bluff they they only follow the important people, and any old average joe doesn&rsquo;t get a response. That particular average old joe did, saying they make the best effort they can to reach out to everyone (<a href="http://twitter.com/HRBlock">HR Block</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/SouthwestAir">Southwest </a>are also doing this quite well).</p>

<p>The other is a little less about blurring the lines, but I still think a great example of a business stepping out of their traditional roles. This one was a story relayed to me by a co-worker. <a href="http://www.zappos.com">Zappos</a>, which is an online shoe company primarily, has a great return policy. In any case, if you don&rsquo;t like the shoe after you receive it, just return it, and they&rsquo;ll even pay for the shipping. This specific incident a woman&rsquo;s husband had recently passed away and she was attempting to return the shoes. She gave the reasoning behind it, and the customer service rep proceeded to go an extra step and send flowers to the funeral. While to some this might be offensive, or at the very least outside the bounds of a normal company, it shoes a company actually caring for people, which wasn&rsquo;t their core business. While I won&rsquo;t go into details of how well this turned out for the company, it&rsquo;s a great example of a company blurring the lines.</p>

<p>In the future I anticipate we will see more and more of companies doing this, actually caring about what someone says/thinks/feels not only about the company, but personally as well. As we get to this it will become less about the buck and more about meeting needs.</p>

			Mixing Personal and Professional, Transparency</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Someone recently commented on by tweeting after having given my two weeks notice to my company, that it may not have been the best idea. So as a result I&rsquo;d like to post my reasoning and thought why I feel it is actually a great idea. Even a month before my giving two weeks notice many knew it was likely going to happen, and I personally hope that this allowed those that may have needed to, to better plan accordingly. This also I believe allows me to be more evaluated on my actual merit in some terms. You see if I made it clear that I might be looking at another opportunity, and was not wanted I believe there may have been good reason hints would have been given that I should look harder and more. Instead in was a reasonable bit of the opposite.</p>

<p>However the larger point of what I&rsquo;d like to illustrate is that many of those that I work with I view as more than strictly co-workers. It&rsquo;s not uncommon to meet up with them on a Saturday for drinks or to just hang out. Meanwhile I have many friends who I do not talk to on a daily or even weekly basis, yet still like to keep them informed of what I&rsquo;m up to, just as I look to follow how they are. To me twitter and other social tools are this medium. While some may prefer to keep professional and personal strictly separate entities, I have no problem with the two blurring. In fact I believe it adds to what I bring to the table in both contexts. By no means do I live and breath work, but to me my work is not only a job either. There are times after 5 or 6 o&#8217;clock that I will spend reading about business and technology, in short because they interest me. Though there are times between 8 and 5, that I will have an IM conversation un-work related, or post tweets available to the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Hopefully some may value this transparency, though if you do not, dont add me on facebook, dont follow me on twitter. You&rsquo;ll still get the formal good-bye email with the rest of the group, however, I wouldn&rsquo;t expect you to get updates in 5 years, though that may be what you hope for. Personally I like to keep in touch with those that I enjoy working with, but also care to know about how they are doing with regards to their personal life. To me blurring the lines makes the relationships deeper and life more rewarding</p>

			Adobe Came to Play</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;ve said it before, but in case I haven&rsquo;t voiced it on here yet, watch out for Adobe. They look like they&rsquo;re firing on all cylinders lately and don&rsquo;t look to be slowing down. At Adobe MAX 2007, I saw a preview of many things that were coming up for them. Though from already having worked with Adobe Flex was a fan, at least of the Flex and AIR products. Adobe now seems to be doing as much to drive adoption of the products as they expect from developers.</p>

<p>First came the acquisition of Buzzword, which is a Flex based word application. With additional abilities for users to collaborate, which in my opinion were already slightly superior to Google&rsquo;s word equivalent. Then came Adobe Photoshop Express, this was in a sense a lighter version of Adobe Photoshop, only available online and best of all for <strong>free</strong>. While impressive in their own rights, they really just did a great job of showcasing the power of flex.</p>

<p>Now with acrobat.com adobe seems to have hit a home run. While it may only be a landing place for their in house web applications, it&rsquo;s a landing place that points to a lot of great tools. Namely adobe connect, which at least matches if not passes every virtual meeting tool I&rsquo;ve ever used. With well integrated white-boarding, screen sharing, file sharing, web cams, and dial-in support as well, it will surely be my choice for online meetings in the near future. Once the other tools such as buzzword and potentially other applications others such as google and microsoft will have to very much watch out.</p>

			Changing Etiquette?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A recent conversation of someone that was offended when the were introduced to someone new, then was not greeted first since they were a female brought what follows to mind. The above is a train of thought that came from a 70 year old military wife. I do not believe this is common practice today and is quite rarely found as the common etiquette, but nonetheless I think what is proper etiquette in business is changing quite rapidly. Though I&rsquo;m not sure if <strong>all</strong> of the older ideas and principles have gone away.</p>

<p>I take as a first example zuckerburg, whom is a notoriously difficult interview. Not because he keeps things hidden, or is sealed tight about the company, but rather that his soft skills are not his strength. His strength is building a web product that millions of people find worthwhile to divulge hours of their day into it.</p>

<p>Even two years ago when you were disgruntled with a company you may have gotten a few drinks in you and talked to a friend about your displeasure. But it certainly was not made fully public for anyone to see. At best you could only hope you were simply privy to things that would be brought to the publics eye from a larger misdoing either legally or that a mass-crowd found a problem with. But for simply being overworked, underpaid, or in some other odd way mistreated there was no politically correct outlet to speak through.</p>

<p>However in the past years it has become extremely common for those that are still employed, or were employed to voice their complaints and bring to light the details that were once hidden. I think of Zed Shaw&rsquo;s rant on rails which calls out specific companies, or an older blog the diary of a mac genius, who gave detailed behind the scenes information of an apple customer support genius bar. While I&rsquo;ll concede for the mass majority if it&rsquo;s published it&rsquo;s doesn&rsquo;t mean its consumed, so it&rsquo;s not a dramatic effect on any single business, I still find it hard to believe that this overall shift of users freely publishing is not going to be able to be stopped by companies. As we approach web 3.0 and have a better ability to pull in a larger base of information that&rsquo;s more relevant this information may become more and more helpful to users.</p>

<p>Regardless of the effects, it seems the standard procedures for what is proper etiquette are changing. Whether its talking about your place of employment, or HR checking out you&rsquo;re facebook profile to see if you&rsquo;d be a risk for the company, the lines are being blurred from both sides and the barriers that once existed are now being torn down.</p>

			Is Web 2.0 More Utopian?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I recently read an article on Techcrunch on how web 2.0 had undoubtedly made an impact, but had yet to truly make money. From my stance they is really one way to make money on the web, which is through advertising (paid subscription services are dying). This can either be done through a simple banner ad, or something that can more easily be deemed a qualified lead or referral. Ads will always be there, but if web 2.0 is to start making money it must be on improving the measurement and throughput of qualified leads.</p>

<p>Without going into too much detail on referrals and qualified leads I&rsquo;d like to mention a great example of this, mint.com. Mint offers a great free service of managing your personal finances. Throwing out security and sharing your data (another time another place), they do a great job of categorizing and monitoring your finances. In exchange they have access to your spending history. So you give them your spending history, in exchange that have hundreds of thousands of peoples data, such as what credit card you use, who your cable provider is. With this mint does what I believe is a good job of generating referrals, but telling you how much you can save by switching from Internet provider A at $60 per month to Internet provider B at $30 per month. They&rsquo;re not just giving ads for the sake of it, they&rsquo;re giving me something that I would actually want.</p>

<p>Does this lead to higher or lower revenue? We&rsquo;ll this I&rsquo;m not sure of, but with regards to advertising, feel this is a more better fit for a user. I only get things that the service provider thinks <strong>I want </strong>not what they <strong>think they can sell me</strong>. As we reach more of the semantic understanding of the web I believe this will prevail and make web 2.0 more profitable, but it cannot be done with web 2.0 alone.</p>

			Consuming Versus Publishing</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&rsquo;m finding it a growingly interesting balance in consuming versus producing information. I also feel with the increase in availability of information, the barrier to entry in so many areas are shrinking rapidly. I think of some of the areas where the barriers to entry are typically much higher. 15 years ago we would have never seen a 23 year old as the CEO of a company valued at 15 billion dollars. While my vantage point even within the business market is narrow, as I think in relation to technology I still believe it applies across the board. Now it no longer takes 20 years in business , learning from your experiences and mistakes, to have the knowledge and ability to run a large company. In fact, in some cases that may be a hinderance, because you will expect that your previous experiences have prepared you to handle the situation, which you may not view as different. The difference in today&rsquo;s world is that businesses, the ones that will at least be around in 5, 10, and 20 years are the ones that manage to adapt to change extremely quickly.</p>

<p>But I digress, I&rsquo;m starting to find it increasingly more difficult to determine what the balance is between creating and consuming content. I read on average 200 blog posts per day, while posting an average of two. I see and read an average of 500 tweets per day, while posting an average of 4. I listen to and watch an average of 3 podcasts per day, and publish none. Meanwhile I find myself having a variety of conversations about all the things I read, yet few of these are web communications, or at best over IM. While there should always be a learning curve in getting familiar with an industry space or domain expertise, and what point should it tip so you can become a publisher of content.</p>

<p>More specifically I&rsquo;m curious what the current actual positions of those are that consume and those that publish both currently and from a long term perspective. You see because I consume content does it make me more likely to take and readily apply that. Or because I am polishing and publishing content does it mean when I interact with others it will be more polished, perhaps allowing me to sell better.</p>

<p>Really it&rsquo;d be great to get some sort of focus group stats around this&hellip;

			Reduced Noise in Exchange for Transparency</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>As I&rsquo;ve become more or less a web 2.0 whore. I&rsquo;ve also had a great interest in web 3.0 and what it will fortell. Most believe natural language and the semantic web will play a large role in that. And while it will that will not be the end result of web 3.0. While web 2.0 included AJAX and Flex, that really doesn&rsquo;t fully encompass what they are. Web 3.0 to sum it up most simply will be about reducing the noise of the web. While I can take very little credit for this idea as I have heard others say the same or at least similar things, there is an interesting side that I believe most have not thought about.</p>

<p>You see, in order to reduce the noise of the web you have to know about me and what I consider noise. In order for someone to do this we have to be willing to give up information about ourselves, some of which people consider private. I still recall a conversation which I posted on a few days ago about users not wanting to give out their private information. I believe this attitude is very quickly becoming old hat, while there are individuals that will stay this way for several decades as a collective whole it&rsquo;s a fleeting attitude. I think for example of mint.com which I willingly give all of my financial account information to in order for them to simplify my life. Instead of a massive collection of emails and notifications I get summarized views from them. While there still is the chance for noise as I could receive text messages about every transaction that happens, I have the ability now to filter that noise.</p>

<p>Noise is something that some people love, take scoble for example who loves having hundreds of twitter messages fly across his screen every few minutes. Though for the vast majority to reduce the noise to allow us to accomplish more in a day, but also have more time to enjoy it will be the key to the future of the web.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve talked with some that believe that government policy will come after people start to become too open with their information. My perspective is that as long as there are safeguards around that information then there will be little barriers to users giving it away freely very soon. But in truth only time will tell at how well companies and products can reduce this noise and truly learn about a user, and if there will be regulation preventing such improvements.</p>

			Why Twitter Matters to You</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Products Company &ndash; For me this may the be  most obvious and strongest reason for any of the four groups to begin  using  Twitter.  It&rsquo;s quite simple, people use your product or service, people talk about your product or service, people ARE talking about your product or service on Twitter. Regardless of whether you want it or not, people are going to talk and they&rsquo;ll speak their minds. I don&rsquo;t believe I know of a company that wouldn&rsquo;t want to know what it&rsquo;s consumers are saying about them, much less that wouldn&rsquo;t want to be part of that conversation. But if they really do want to, they have the chance to at least be part of it over twitter if they so choose.</p>

<p>Enterprise &ndash; The enterprise has two main reasons why I feel twitter is of importance. Those were highlighted in a little more detail in a previous post, but to sum them up&hellip; Twitter is an asynchronous IM that you could rollout within an enterprise and have control over. You could own the messages, which allows for companies concerned about data security to feel more at ease. It is a convenient medium to convey status to a team and reduce meetings while increasing knowledge flow.</p>

<p>Additionally twitter starts to become a place for brainstorming and flushing out ideas. On twitter I follow people with similar interests in similar spaces. As I have a fraction of an idea, or a problem I encounter I post to twitter. Others throw in their opinion and a few hours or days later I have hundreds of thoughts around it, and a hopeful solution or flushed out thought.</p>

<p>Power user &ndash; This is an interesting group, because I feel web 3.0 will change in many ways how this group works. Few users like a lot of noise, few users like to see hundreds of messages fly across their screen each hour, and even fewer are truly productive with this. However, for the time being, there are users that want that noise, and that only seem to become more productive and thrive further with the more they have of it. For those users twitter is a gold mine, you can&rsquo;t find a place where you can get much more unfiltered noise, with the exception of the web as a whole. While in its most raw form twitter is extremely noisy, there are a variety of methods to filter this, which is where twitter seems to become most useful to the rest of the population.</p>

<p>Consumer &ndash; If you haven&rsquo;t fit yourself into any of the above categories then this will be where you fall. If you use facebook, email, or IM to communicate with friends, then twitter will be your friend in coming years. I remember a time where it seemed almost a set time at night I would see my buddy list on AIM start to grow as the usual friends sign on. I wouldn&rsquo;t talk to all each day, but over the period of a week would talk to most on there, get updates on their lives and make distant plans to catch up at some point. As the world seems to spin our lives become more hectic and complicated with each passing day. Some nights I sit at my machine and see only a fraction of people that I&rsquo;ve talked to in over a year on AIM. I debate whether to reach out to them to hear their latest and greatest news, or avoid some of the awkwardness. Though I genuinely do care and would like to know, it&rsquo;s not always a simple and relaxed conversation to feel a part of their life.</p>

<p>Facebook has done a reasonable job of overcoming this, but facebook has hit the tipping point, where you now seem to know more people on there than you actually do. People spend more time, wasting time than actually reconnecting, and at the end of the day it&rsquo;s originally goal has started to seemingly fade.</p>

<p>Twitter on the other hang allows me to have conversations with friends over a longer period of time. I don&rsquo;t have to sit and wait for my friend to respond, he gets to it when he can. But for me it still maintains that direct communication path feel like AIM. I can also communicate from one to many people much easier, now instead of sending out an email to all my contacts I post a tweet, then all of my friends get the message. All-in-all what twitter really gives you is a way to still feel close and connected to those people. While a facebook status message may work just the same, it somehow seems to get lost amongst all the noise.</p>

			Web, Scalability, SAAS</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div>I was having a conversation a few days ago with someone and we were back and forth about software development within the enterprise and startups/web companies. The point kept going back and forth of how facebook/google/amazon doesn&#8217;t really apply to enterprise software development. His primary point was that none of these sites really have a deep feature list. While they&#8217;re able to handle scalability well, it&#8217;s not the same as supporting a variety of features.

At the time one startup that would be a prime example of what I&#8217;m about to detail did not come to mind. Salesforce, salesforce has a respectable feature list, yet is also one of the web companies that has managed to scale well. The interesting thing about web companies is the best ones are the ones that can truly scale to a mass audience. Many can offer an okay service, but scaling that service is a truly difficult task.

Many would argue that extensive testing and rigorous QA will help to offer enterprise quality software. But to this note I very strongly disagree, in coming years we are going to see more and more of a facebook model. Facebook as they develop code they test against live data, it will be the individuals that coded and perhaps a few others, but is really not much more than a smoke test to make sure things are still working. They then role out the new code and when things break they are ready to fix them. Why does this work? Why are users okay with the site being down at times? Well personally I will settle for more features at a few inconveniences most days of the week. Seldom is software 100% solid, I have even seen bugs in notepad, so as a result you cannot expect software to be perfect.

Instead with a SAAS, software as a service, model you do not have to worry about software updates. You simple update the site or service, and then you can role out these features more rapidly. Instead of office being a 2-3 year large product update, you push new features to the site at a weekly basis. You also alleviate some of your burden of supporting a variety of installations and versions of your product.

Because of these points it&#8217;s more important that we pay attention to these companies that have gotten scalability right. The facebook&#8217;s, google&#8217;s, amazon&#8217;s of the world that can handle millions of hits per second, once enterprises have a firm understanding of this, they can attempt to them build their feature set within a SAAS model. When we get to this point features will be built in faster and software will begin to grow faster than in previous years.

			Bearish on Mobile</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that mobile devices will be everywhere and will replace computers for what seems like decades, but is probably growing on 6 or 7 years now. The thing is I don&rsquo;t really need a desktop with me every where I go. Seldom am I somewhere and I wish I had access to Microsoft Office or wish I had Eclipse or Visual Studio. While I concede that I occasionally watch youtube on my IPhone, this is far more rare than it is common. Most of the time it&rsquo;s simply for the wow factor that I pull it out and load up the &ldquo;Here comes another bubble&rdquo; video.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I will admit that I do love certain things about my mobile device. The ability to, within three button clicks, publish a photo to twitter or flickr. Or to quickly to live micro-blogging from an event, or (not I, but others) the ability to stream an interview from my phone and have others text questions to ask. But is this truly what I use on my desktop, yes I have IM and micro-blogging clients, but it&rsquo;s far different. I seem to care more about existing services integrating to support SMS, or mobile applications, than about my mobile device being able to run whatever is on my desktop.</p>

<p>My primary point here is that I care less about supporting multimedia formats, applications, and power. And more about data and accessibility. Mobile devices are at a point now where I could locate friends, communicate with others, and have access to my small pieces of data I want. We simply need to have the backbone systems support them more.</p>
