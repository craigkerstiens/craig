	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I often encounter people whether at my office or at other places of employment that are distraught after getting an earful from a manager from some problem arising. The problem usually isn&rsquo;t in their control, and therefore they don&rsquo;t understand why they get heat for this. Most managers though do actually understand when issues come up, however what they don&rsquo;t appreciate is late notice, lack of problem solving, and dictating what should be done next.</p>

			Forget Doing Something Better, Do Something Different</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I have a tendency of really latching onto very simple ideas. Typically these ideas don&rsquo;t require complex engineering to make them happen. This is not to say the engineering is not important, but more so that it is some variation of engineering feats that have been done before. The reason I tend to like these over more complex engineering that really makes something better is that making something better is typically a marginal improvement. When it&rsquo;s a marginal improvement it&rsquo;s a lot harder to sell.</p>

<p>With marginal improvements you have to:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Convince the customer it&#8217;s not good enough today</li>
    <li>Convince the customer that you&#8217;re better</li>
    <li>Convince the customer you&#8217;re worth the headache of changing</li>
</ol>


<p>While a lot of companies focus solely on taking an existing problem and solving it better than someone else has, I have my doubts about how reproducible this model is. If I&rsquo;m a large company with lots of resources I&rsquo;m going to keep iterating and improving myself, which means a smaller company really has to have some magic bullet that will displace me.</p>

<p>In contrast if I address a problem that hasn&rsquo;t been solved my life instantly becomes a lot easier. I no longer have an argument of something not being good enough today, it becomes a question of value and how much its worth to solve the problem. Haggling over price is a conversation I&rsquo;d rather have than trying to justify value and convince a customer they&rsquo;ve been wrong in their choice for so many years.</p>

<p>Over the coming days I&rsquo;m going to be posting a few of these examples/ideas and why I like them. Many of them are still being thought through, and while as I sort them out, I&rsquo;m generally happy to publish high points about them. The even bigger key here is that success is typically in the execution and less so in the idea, though even then I&rsquo;d prefer to execute on something that has less battles than something that from the onset has more. By doing something that is being done today you get no advantages of penetrating the market.</p>

		<div id="_mcePaste">A few days ago I was told things needed to be parallelized, not serialized with regards to the process. To me there could not be much more of a detrimental approach.</div>


<div></div>


<div id="_mcePaste">To give some background there is currently some selling going on, as the case often is with selling you sell the next version of what you&#8217;ll have. Or really sell what you think customers want, and that gives you validation if you should build it or not. I&#8217;m generally quite happy with this process, assuming you&#8217;ll have some time to test the market out, then build it. In fact this is the way a lot of businesses proceed and is a valid process. My problem isn&#8217;t with this process, it&#8217;s that I was told that we have to deviate from this process due to time constraints.</div>

		<p>The web is becoming saturated. It&rsquo;s no longer the pimply faced 20 somethings living in their mom&rsquo;s basements that are the key users and the source of most of the traffic on the web. Now you have communities for pregnant moms, sites for elderly widows looking to date, and social sites for kids from the time they&rsquo;re able to talk. So now that the web is hitting its saturation point of types of people interacting it becomes a critical issue to take advantage of those users and get them to do more.</p>

			Behavioral Targeting Versus Contextual Advertising</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There&rsquo;s a continual shift that seems to be happening on whether contextual advertising is better than behavioral. It seems that most people are becoming bigger and bigger on behavioral, and assuming that contextual has reached it&rsquo;s peak. After meeting with a company that at first started to do both, blurring the lines, taking advantage of each when they had appropriate data it started to become clear that they more so have their place and time. Behavioral and Contextual shouldn&rsquo;t be direct competitors.</p>

			Does Authenticity Matter?</a>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">I&#8217;ve thought for some considerable time now about Twitter and how I feel it actually has more value than facebook with regards to advertising. The difference is context. However, I want to take a moment to look at it from a different angle. There is another key factor that drives the value of the network and the way you can monetize it, The authenticity of the network.</div>


<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Facebook is as authentic of a network as you can have, you have you, you are you, you&#8217;re not FunChick21, or MotorcycleGuy42, You&#8217;re Craig Kerstiens. You have a birthdate, which is likely you&#8217;re birthdate, you have a job that is your job, you have friends that are you&#8217;re friends. Facebook is probably as close to a virtual representation of your true life as you can get on a social network.</div>


<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Then you have Twitter. Twitter is probably as inauthentic as they come. You ARE FunChick21 or MotorcycleGuy42. You have that name, and that&#8217;s it. You have friends, but they&#8217;re up to you, it&#8217;s a one way relationship, not confirmation of friendship. For that reason you have 1,000,000 people following Ashton Kutcher, and he follows under 100. You&#8217;re friends could be celebrities, they could be friends, they could be random people that you liked their tweets.</div>


<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Facebook from an ad perspective I know almost everything I could want to about you from an ad targeting perspective. Few sites could give much more demographic info that I&#8217;d want to target effectively. Twitter I have next to nothing, I have a user name, and the content of what you say.</div>


<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">So there&#8217;s an advantage to facebook. But then you have the context of what I&#8217;m trying to do. If you&#8217;re facebook, you have users engaged in the site not wanting to leave. If you&#8217;re Twitter you have users that won&#8217;t be on the site for beyond 60 seconds. Getting them to leave shouldn&#8217;t be an issue, which means if you can drive where they are leaving to it should work out well for you.</div>


<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">But there&#8217;s a final piece. It&#8217;s a heavily growing marketplace, that really neither of the major communities picks up on, and it&#8217;s virtual goods. Virtual goods exist in either form of network, but neither seems to take advantage, meanwhile it&#8217;s the entire basis behinds such communities as World of Warcraft. How will they start to roll into mainstream networks, that&#8217;s yet to be seen, but I&#8217;ll be curious if virtual goods can become dominant in authentic networks or if they&#8217;ll primarily reside in inauthentic networks as they do today.</div>

However, I want to take a moment to look at it from a different angle.

		<p>I&rsquo;ve done some recent advising for someone working on a site that&rsquo;s of a social nature. The site is intended in some form to motivate users, the initial thought on this was to define a lot of rules, and send automated messages to users. To me this approach felt very 1990&rsquo;s. So assuming that were true, then comes the question of how do you motivate users?

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Three times in recent years I&rsquo;ve had to micromanage others. Though probably in the contrary form to what you would expect. Most people think of micromanagement as their manager wanting to know every detail about their day, and be involved in every minute task. In most cases this form of micromanagement is never received well. Generally my feelings are that if I have to micromanage you, you don&rsquo;t belong in the role you&rsquo;re in, though I suppose exception cases may exist.</p>

			Why the Enterprise Cant Reach Consumers</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Most of my working career has been in what many would call an enterprise environment. Corporate structure well in place at most of them and in those cases any development followed closely to a waterfall methodology. You laid out requirements strictly and then built to those requirements. You essentially had nothing to show until you got to the end product.</p>

<p>Having been in the valley for several years and interacting with some startups and in other settings, I&rsquo;ve seen a very opposite mindset. The &ldquo;release early, release often&rdquo; concept. First you never have clear requirements when dealing with anything a startup should be tackling, if it&rsquo;s a very clear easy to solve problem, then someone else will have already tackled it. If you&rsquo;re doing something new, which you should be you can&rsquo;t gauge how users react, until you actually have something in front of them.</p>

	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Something I learned very early on in my working career, not so much from my experiences but from observing the results of others, was to engage at a social level as early possible. This doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to take time after 5:00 to get to know someone, the best opportunity exists every single day during what you would already do, lunch! Everyone usually takes a break and eats lunch during the day, usually there&rsquo;s two groups in an office. Those that always go out, and those that bring their lunch or meet others for lunch or maybe even work through it. If you notice those in the first group in your office my guess it&rsquo;s usually easier for them to get things done, they&rsquo;re normally a little more in touch with things that are going on. Especially if you can manage to branch out a little and go outside of the people you work with every moment of the day.</p>
