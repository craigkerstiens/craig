			Is Web 2.0 More Utopian?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I recently read an article on Techcrunch on how web 2.0 had undoubtedly made an impact, but had yet to truly make money. From my stance they is really one way to make money on the web, which is through advertising (paid subscription services are dying). This can either be done through a simple banner ad, or something that can more easily be deemed a qualified lead or referral. Ads will always be there, but if web 2.0 is to start making money it must be on improving the measurement and throughput of qualified leads.</p>

<p>Without going into too much detail on referrals and qualified leads I&rsquo;d like to mention a great example of this, mint.com. Mint offers a great free service of managing your personal finances. Throwing out security and sharing your data (another time another place), they do a great job of categorizing and monitoring your finances. In exchange they have access to your spending history. So you give them your spending history, in exchange that have hundreds of thousands of peoples data, such as what credit card you use, who your cable provider is. With this mint does what I believe is a good job of generating referrals, but telling you how much you can save by switching from Internet provider A at $60 per month to Internet provider B at $30 per month. They&rsquo;re not just giving ads for the sake of it, they&rsquo;re giving me something that I would actually want.</p>

<p>Does this lead to higher or lower revenue? We&rsquo;ll this I&rsquo;m not sure of, but with regards to advertising, feel this is a more better fit for a user. I only get things that the service provider thinks <strong>I want </strong>not what they <strong>think they can sell me</strong>. As we reach more of the semantic understanding of the web I believe this will prevail and make web 2.0 more profitable, but it cannot be done with web 2.0 alone.</p>

			Consuming Versus Publishing</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&rsquo;m finding it a growingly interesting balance in consuming versus producing information. I also feel with the increase in availability of information, the barrier to entry in so many areas are shrinking rapidly. I think of some of the areas where the barriers to entry are typically much higher. 15 years ago we would have never seen a 23 year old as the CEO of a company valued at 15 billion dollars. While my vantage point even within the business market is narrow, as I think in relation to technology I still believe it applies across the board. Now it no longer takes 20 years in business , learning from your experiences and mistakes, to have the knowledge and ability to run a large company. In fact, in some cases that may be a hinderance, because you will expect that your previous experiences have prepared you to handle the situation, which you may not view as different. The difference in today&rsquo;s world is that businesses, the ones that will at least be around in 5, 10, and 20 years are the ones that manage to adapt to change extremely quickly.</p>

<p>But I digress, I&rsquo;m starting to find it increasingly more difficult to determine what the balance is between creating and consuming content. I read on average 200 blog posts per day, while posting an average of two. I see and read an average of 500 tweets per day, while posting an average of 4. I listen to and watch an average of 3 podcasts per day, and publish none. Meanwhile I find myself having a variety of conversations about all the things I read, yet few of these are web communications, or at best over IM. While there should always be a learning curve in getting familiar with an industry space or domain expertise, and what point should it tip so you can become a publisher of content.</p>

<p>More specifically I&rsquo;m curious what the current actual positions of those are that consume and those that publish both currently and from a long term perspective. You see because I consume content does it make me more likely to take and readily apply that. Or because I am polishing and publishing content does it mean when I interact with others it will be more polished, perhaps allowing me to sell better.</p>

<p>Really it&rsquo;d be great to get some sort of focus group stats around this&hellip;

			Reduced Noise in Exchange for Transparency</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>As I&rsquo;ve become more or less a web 2.0 whore. I&rsquo;ve also had a great interest in web 3.0 and what it will fortell. Most believe natural language and the semantic web will play a large role in that. And while it will that will not be the end result of web 3.0. While web 2.0 included AJAX and Flex, that really doesn&rsquo;t fully encompass what they are. Web 3.0 to sum it up most simply will be about reducing the noise of the web. While I can take very little credit for this idea as I have heard others say the same or at least similar things, there is an interesting side that I believe most have not thought about.</p>

<p>You see, in order to reduce the noise of the web you have to know about me and what I consider noise. In order for someone to do this we have to be willing to give up information about ourselves, some of which people consider private. I still recall a conversation which I posted on a few days ago about users not wanting to give out their private information. I believe this attitude is very quickly becoming old hat, while there are individuals that will stay this way for several decades as a collective whole it&rsquo;s a fleeting attitude. I think for example of mint.com which I willingly give all of my financial account information to in order for them to simplify my life. Instead of a massive collection of emails and notifications I get summarized views from them. While there still is the chance for noise as I could receive text messages about every transaction that happens, I have the ability now to filter that noise.</p>

<p>Noise is something that some people love, take scoble for example who loves having hundreds of twitter messages fly across his screen every few minutes. Though for the vast majority to reduce the noise to allow us to accomplish more in a day, but also have more time to enjoy it will be the key to the future of the web.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve talked with some that believe that government policy will come after people start to become too open with their information. My perspective is that as long as there are safeguards around that information then there will be little barriers to users giving it away freely very soon. But in truth only time will tell at how well companies and products can reduce this noise and truly learn about a user, and if there will be regulation preventing such improvements.</p>

			Why Twitter Matters to You</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Products Company &ndash; For me this may the be  most obvious and strongest reason for any of the four groups to begin  using  Twitter.  It&rsquo;s quite simple, people use your product or service, people talk about your product or service, people ARE talking about your product or service on Twitter. Regardless of whether you want it or not, people are going to talk and they&rsquo;ll speak their minds. I don&rsquo;t believe I know of a company that wouldn&rsquo;t want to know what it&rsquo;s consumers are saying about them, much less that wouldn&rsquo;t want to be part of that conversation. But if they really do want to, they have the chance to at least be part of it over twitter if they so choose.</p>

<p>Enterprise &ndash; The enterprise has two main reasons why I feel twitter is of importance. Those were highlighted in a little more detail in a previous post, but to sum them up&hellip; Twitter is an asynchronous IM that you could rollout within an enterprise and have control over. You could own the messages, which allows for companies concerned about data security to feel more at ease. It is a convenient medium to convey status to a team and reduce meetings while increasing knowledge flow.</p>

<p>Additionally twitter starts to become a place for brainstorming and flushing out ideas. On twitter I follow people with similar interests in similar spaces. As I have a fraction of an idea, or a problem I encounter I post to twitter. Others throw in their opinion and a few hours or days later I have hundreds of thoughts around it, and a hopeful solution or flushed out thought.</p>

<p>Power user &ndash; This is an interesting group, because I feel web 3.0 will change in many ways how this group works. Few users like a lot of noise, few users like to see hundreds of messages fly across their screen each hour, and even fewer are truly productive with this. However, for the time being, there are users that want that noise, and that only seem to become more productive and thrive further with the more they have of it. For those users twitter is a gold mine, you can&rsquo;t find a place where you can get much more unfiltered noise, with the exception of the web as a whole. While in its most raw form twitter is extremely noisy, there are a variety of methods to filter this, which is where twitter seems to become most useful to the rest of the population.</p>

<p>Consumer &ndash; If you haven&rsquo;t fit yourself into any of the above categories then this will be where you fall. If you use facebook, email, or IM to communicate with friends, then twitter will be your friend in coming years. I remember a time where it seemed almost a set time at night I would see my buddy list on AIM start to grow as the usual friends sign on. I wouldn&rsquo;t talk to all each day, but over the period of a week would talk to most on there, get updates on their lives and make distant plans to catch up at some point. As the world seems to spin our lives become more hectic and complicated with each passing day. Some nights I sit at my machine and see only a fraction of people that I&rsquo;ve talked to in over a year on AIM. I debate whether to reach out to them to hear their latest and greatest news, or avoid some of the awkwardness. Though I genuinely do care and would like to know, it&rsquo;s not always a simple and relaxed conversation to feel a part of their life.</p>

<p>Facebook has done a reasonable job of overcoming this, but facebook has hit the tipping point, where you now seem to know more people on there than you actually do. People spend more time, wasting time than actually reconnecting, and at the end of the day it&rsquo;s originally goal has started to seemingly fade.</p>

<p>Twitter on the other hang allows me to have conversations with friends over a longer period of time. I don&rsquo;t have to sit and wait for my friend to respond, he gets to it when he can. But for me it still maintains that direct communication path feel like AIM. I can also communicate from one to many people much easier, now instead of sending out an email to all my contacts I post a tweet, then all of my friends get the message. All-in-all what twitter really gives you is a way to still feel close and connected to those people. While a facebook status message may work just the same, it somehow seems to get lost amongst all the noise.</p>

			Web, Scalability, SAAS</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div>I was having a conversation a few days ago with someone and we were back and forth about software development within the enterprise and startups/web companies. The point kept going back and forth of how facebook/google/amazon doesn&#8217;t really apply to enterprise software development. His primary point was that none of these sites really have a deep feature list. While they&#8217;re able to handle scalability well, it&#8217;s not the same as supporting a variety of features.

At the time one startup that would be a prime example of what I&#8217;m about to detail did not come to mind. Salesforce, salesforce has a respectable feature list, yet is also one of the web companies that has managed to scale well. The interesting thing about web companies is the best ones are the ones that can truly scale to a mass audience. Many can offer an okay service, but scaling that service is a truly difficult task.

Many would argue that extensive testing and rigorous QA will help to offer enterprise quality software. But to this note I very strongly disagree, in coming years we are going to see more and more of a facebook model. Facebook as they develop code they test against live data, it will be the individuals that coded and perhaps a few others, but is really not much more than a smoke test to make sure things are still working. They then role out the new code and when things break they are ready to fix them. Why does this work? Why are users okay with the site being down at times? Well personally I will settle for more features at a few inconveniences most days of the week. Seldom is software 100% solid, I have even seen bugs in notepad, so as a result you cannot expect software to be perfect.

Instead with a SAAS, software as a service, model you do not have to worry about software updates. You simple update the site or service, and then you can role out these features more rapidly. Instead of office being a 2-3 year large product update, you push new features to the site at a weekly basis. You also alleviate some of your burden of supporting a variety of installations and versions of your product.

Because of these points it&#8217;s more important that we pay attention to these companies that have gotten scalability right. The facebook&#8217;s, google&#8217;s, amazon&#8217;s of the world that can handle millions of hits per second, once enterprises have a firm understanding of this, they can attempt to them build their feature set within a SAAS model. When we get to this point features will be built in faster and software will begin to grow faster than in previous years.

			Bearish on Mobile</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that mobile devices will be everywhere and will replace computers for what seems like decades, but is probably growing on 6 or 7 years now. The thing is I don&rsquo;t really need a desktop with me every where I go. Seldom am I somewhere and I wish I had access to Microsoft Office or wish I had Eclipse or Visual Studio. While I concede that I occasionally watch youtube on my IPhone, this is far more rare than it is common. Most of the time it&rsquo;s simply for the wow factor that I pull it out and load up the &ldquo;Here comes another bubble&rdquo; video.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I will admit that I do love certain things about my mobile device. The ability to, within three button clicks, publish a photo to twitter or flickr. Or to quickly to live micro-blogging from an event, or (not I, but others) the ability to stream an interview from my phone and have others text questions to ask. But is this truly what I use on my desktop, yes I have IM and micro-blogging clients, but it&rsquo;s far different. I seem to care more about existing services integrating to support SMS, or mobile applications, than about my mobile device being able to run whatever is on my desktop.</p>

<p>My primary point here is that I care less about supporting multimedia formats, applications, and power. And more about data and accessibility. Mobile devices are at a point now where I could locate friends, communicate with others, and have access to my small pieces of data I want. We simply need to have the backbone systems support them more.</p>

			Large Corporations Versus Startups</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>After a year of living in Silicon Valley it&rsquo;s hard not to be consumed with the excitement around one startup after the next. The hopes of being the next eBay, Google, or Facebook lie within many of individuals in the area. Some pursue it, some write it off as a distant hope, and still others just want to be a part of them at some point.</p>

<p>But why would someone just want to be a part of Google 5 years ago? The first thing that comes to mind is money, and while thats nice, I don&rsquo;t believe its at the root of it. There&rsquo;s a vastly different atmosphere at a startup. For one you have a say, right now if I left my company, I&rsquo;d get good-byes from 100 people, be missed by maybe 20, and the other 159,900 would move along as if nothing happened. But if I left a startup the entire company notices, so there is a closer sense of belonging. Still I don&rsquo;t believe this is the heart of it.</p>

<p>In part if you have the ability to make it at a startup you&rsquo;re of a different breed. If a startup excites you, you&rsquo;re of a different breed. You eat, sleep, breath what you do. In a 160,000 person company I don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s any way 100% of the employees decided it was a dream job, or as a 10 year old, or even at 16 it was what they wanted to do with their life. But the kid that was developing at 12 his own first person shooter game, or at 16 was following the markets and getting a summer job to be able to invest, those are of a different breed. For those, it&rsquo;s not a job, its a portion of who they are. You don&rsquo;t do home and unwind, you go home and read more blogs, dive further into your area of expertise, and work on your own projects that allow you to bring more expertise into the workplace.</p>

<p>Perhaps this same attitude and drive applies in other industries, though I have the greatest insight into tech/web companies. There was a statement made by Paul Graham of Y Combinator at startup school recently. He said that investors are looking for the type of individuals that don&rsquo;t need them, the type that are going to make it regardless of what everyone else says and who supports them. This is succinctly different than the corporate world, where you have to have validation all across the board to be able to move forward.</p>

<p>As I write this and contemplate more I believe it becomes even more of a chicken and egg problem. Startups require a certain type of individual, but those individuals are the ones best suited for startups.</p>

			Twitter Will Be Commonplace in the Enterprise</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Twitter is great for a few key reasons, first let me highlight the two <strong>key</strong> uses I feel it has in the enterprise.</p>

<ol>
    <li>As an asynchronous instant message or status message. Companies are constantly reporting status back and forth. But when someone asks for status I don&#8217;t always have bandwidth to give it, then when I&#8217;m available to give it, not everyone is free to hear. Instead why not cut down the meeting times and I simply publish messages only to those that its directed at, then they consume when they&#8217;re ready to. Additionally a twitter-like ability would be easier to control. This would allow twitter to be present where IM is still currently banned in some organizations. Yes, it may be hard to believe, but some companies still don&#8217;t trust their employees to use IM as an effective communication tool.</li>
    <li>Ideation! When I have a fraction of a thought I don&#8217;t know what to do with it. When I have a complete, full-fledged out thought, I have a blog post about it. However if I&#8217;m thinking about how I don&#8217;t like the shape of a soda can or how I think email should be improved I have no medium to communicate that, except ad-hoc conversations. With twitter I say that email should be improved, but I&#8217;m not sure how. Then tens to hundreds of users give their input on why they feel its broken, and my thoughts start to become more solid. By simply limited users to 140 characters it changes the psychology around my posts, and allows content to be created on twitter, verses simply published such as on blogs</li>
</ol>


<p>So with those key uses, what about adoption. So what if it has these great uses, if no one really buys in. Well while what I&rsquo;m suggesting is twitter-<strong>like </strong>functionality, which could really be delivered by a lot of providers or a custom solution. I&rsquo;d like to examine the growth curve of email and IM within the workplace, but will do that in a later post. The keys to twitter are the character limit, the one to many conversation as a default (with options for direct public messages, and direct private messages), and finally open access. I can read and publish to twitter from my phone, IM, the web, the desktop, or other sources. This only simplifies the number of sites I have to go to, and well my life.</p>

			Adobe AIR Is a Game Changer, if People Would Build for It&#8230;</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Spend five minutes talking to me about technology or business and you&rsquo;ll quickly realize I&rsquo;m a fan of Adobe AIR. Adobe has done a very good job building a cross-platform runtime, and providing tools that make the transition from the web to the desktop quite minimal.</p>

<p>First to elaborate why I like AIR. For one I&rsquo;m a fan of web 2.0, the sites feel cleaner, smoother, and drive new capabilities. Versus most desktop applications that are starting to feel old, and much like 1990&rsquo;s Java Applets do on the web. With Flex Builder, which is an IDE for developing for flash and/or AIR, I can develop a sweet website, but then quickly port it to the desktop while maintaining a rich web 2.0 feel.</p>

<p>Second, did I mention it&rsquo;s cross-platform? Windows, OSX, Linux, the application in AIR will look/feel/function the same. So what? This could have been done other ways right? Well here is where I start to place my bets, no one else has really done anything in this area as well as Adobe so far. Also Adobe has made their long term strategy clear, they want to truly become a cross-platform runtime. If you&rsquo;re thinking what other platforms right now, you&rsquo;re not thinking large enough. They want AIR to support mobile phones, set-top boxes, likely even gaming consoles. This means I can look at one application on multiple mediums with an either identical look, of very similar one, with minimal development efforts. This allows a developer to then focus even further on improving functionality.</p>

<p>Finally, a bit of a rant. Adobe AIR does not have a true competitor, Silverlight is a competitor to flash (not AIR), Google Gears might be the closest thing to it. But, with regard to gears taking a website and making it available offline isn&rsquo;t all AIR can do. AIR has local file access, local access to some devices, which when you&rsquo;re still within a browser you can&rsquo;t do. Oh, and one feature I personally just like is the auto-update ability of applications.</p>

<p>So&hellip;.. If it&rsquo;s so great, why haven&rsquo;t you heard of it and why aren&rsquo;t you using it? Well the single problem seems to be people building applications on it. I&rsquo;ve seen very few applications that would appeal to mainstream users. I (being an avid fan of AIR and anything web 2.0), will typically use 2 AIR applications per day. One being twhirl, which I use as my primary twitter client. The other tends to vary by needs. However this is contrasted with about 20 applications that I work in over a given day. Most AIR applications thus far are simple, one-off fun applications. Perhaps to really make some penetration there should be some of the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Financial/Stock tool that takes advantage of Adobe&#8217;s charting abilities</li>
    <li>Word Application</li>
    <li>Spreadsheet Editor</li>
    <li>Central social networking aggregator (Think one stop stop to view and update all web 2.0 networks)</li>
    <li>Email client</li>
</ul>

			Why Google May Not Exist in 8-10 Years</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>As I write this, I write only from my vague knowledge of where revenue&rsquo;s come directly from. However, I do hope to back this up in the future with more numeric backing. My title of the post may be quite strong and negative, but I feel it has reasonable ground to stand on, based on one simple principle. A corporation should stick to and focus on it&rsquo;s core business, and exhausting resources outside it&rsquo;s core business could end up costing them their business.</p>

<p>As it is, Google&rsquo;s primary revenue comes from advertising, they&rsquo;re the primary source for advertising because of their search engine. While some may say their core business is data, I disagree, as how are they making money off of data. Data simply allows them to better target their ads. With Google&rsquo;s attitude of &ldquo;Do no wrong&rdquo; they are unlikely to profit from the consolidation and sales of such data.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Google is exhausting their resources with little to show for it. Google over the past 5 years has been hiring some of the top talent within Silicon Valley. Paying good salaries for individuals that are supposed to be some of the best software engineers in the industry. I&rsquo;m not suggesting that the individuals are not sharp, but what has Google truly produced from within it&rsquo;s own walls? Google has bought many of it&rsquo;s out lier products, i.e. Google Earth, Google Spreadsheets, Picasa, and others. First if they are to go into these areas they should strictly focus on acquisitions and have a smaller developer base.</p>

<p>Though from my perspective Google should not be investing in any of the three products mentioned above. While cool and arguably good products, how does Google plan on making money from these? If they are exhausting resources and effort into these products, at the expense of improving both search and ad&rsquo;s they&rsquo;re not focusing on their core business as they should be</p>

<p>Finally, if Google is not pouring into these two areas, search and ad&rsquo;s, it only takes being beaten by one to be unseated. As soon as a company is able to do search better, or ad&rsquo;s better Google will lose the majority, if not all of their revenue. While they may be able to stay around after someone else has become a dominant player, it will only be as a very small fraction of what they currently are.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not predicting that Google <strong>will </strong>be gone in 8 years, but unless they really start to devote to their core business and quit wasting resources on un-needed areas they will have something to worry about.</p>
