    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You&rsquo;ve built your product and you&rsquo;re now ready for your first major launch. Or you&rsquo;ve been through a launch or two, but are looking to scale the process as you&rsquo;re doing more launches and announcements. You really have two options: do it <a href="http://jasonlbaptiste.com/featured-articles/how-i-pitched-techcrunch-and-13-ways-to-get-press-when-you-launch-your-startup/">all on your own</a>, or work with a PR agency. One frequent crossroad is that you&rsquo;re not at the point of a full time PR person, but unsure what a PR agency can offer you; and, further what&rsquo;s the best way to work with them so you&rsquo;re getting the maximum value.</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;ve talked to more startups lately, it&rsquo;s become clear that effectively working with PR teams and the media is mostly learned by doing. Because there&rsquo;s not much guidance out there, here&rsquo;s an attempt at some basic guidelines.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>On PR</h3>

<p>First there&rsquo;s two types here and they&rsquo;re not mutually exclusive. In-house PR is a full time person or team that works within your company, here you&rsquo;ll often have a pretty different experience. From my experience, in-house PR people tend to understand a company message and vision because they are living and breathing your company values every day.</p>

<p>The other alternative is hiring a PR agency. An agency will have several (sometimes hundreds!) of clients. The relationship that you’ll have with an agency is much different than in-house. You&rsquo;ll use them just like you would a consultant or contractor. Most startups end up with the agency approach first, because of the perception of “more people working for a cheaper cost than hiring in-house.” However, it&rsquo;s of note an agency doesn&rsquo;t alleviate you of doing work, nor should you want them to handle all parts of it.</p>

<h4>Messaging</h4>

<p>An agency may offer to help with messaging, but take this somewhat lightly. I don&rsquo;t doubt that some are very good at it, but in most cases I&rsquo;ve found they don&rsquo;t have the same amount of customer interaction as you as a founder or early employee would. Further, your vision of impact to the market and direction may be more distant than theirs. You should expect to own your messaging, just like you own your product.</p>

<p>Where they can heavily help is providing a lot of structured frameworks for helping you get to your messaging. Some pretty basic templates of standard questions for customers and partners can go along way in helping you actually uncover what they feel your value is.</p>

<p><em>On your key messaging/value prop, there&rsquo;s two pieces I&rsquo;ll drop in here. While I&rsquo;d love to write another long post on it, I wonder when I&rsquo;ll actually get it out. So the first is pitch the problem you&rsquo;re trying to solve–<a href="http://500hats.typepad.com/500blogs/2009/08/your-solution-is-not-my-problem.html">Dave McClure</a> talks about this as well as anyone. The second is don&rsquo;t pitch features, pitch the use cases and solutions. Pitch what&rsquo;s possible</em></p>

<h4>Pitching</h4>

<p>This is the number one area I&rsquo;ve found that having PR makes a huge difference. In the world of reporting, different reporters have different beats (areas of coverage), styles, outreach preferences, and most importantly, different relationships with companies and people. Knowing <em>all</em> of this and how to pitch a story to them is key. Yes you can spend hours researching and creating a perfect story just for them, and do that again, and again and hopefully land some coverage. But I&rsquo;d argue a bit: that&rsquo;s not the best use of your time.</p>

<p>With a good PR person or agency you&rsquo;ll be able to strike a mix of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Here&rsquo;s the outlets I want to be in and why (have a good reason for why).</li>
<li>Understanding the audience and readership.</li>
<li>What outlets you feel like your key customers are reading, and validate this with the agency.</li>
</ul>


<p>From there, if you&rsquo;ve found a good agency they already have relationships with your key journalists / publications. So if you have a compelling product, you just need to give them the right messaging of the particular launch or news.</p>

<h4>What else to expect from your agency</h4>

<p>A surprise for some is how the whole process works. The agency is going to be there on the phone with you. You&rsquo;re not going to hang out over beers while pitching being chummy. The reporter is listening to multiple other pitches, it&rsquo;s likely they had one right before you and right after. The agency is there listening, helping keep time and track of conversation for reporter fact-checking after the interview.</p>

<p>Hopefully they&rsquo;re also keeping notes. They should be able to provide you with some high level notes of what message resonated with each reporter and what didn&rsquo;t, what you covered, and what they asked. This is especially useful for future interactions.</p>

<p>Similarly you should get a briefing 1 pager ahead of time. You should be able to skim this, you don&rsquo;t have to memorize. But it&rsquo;ll include key things about recent articles written by the reporter, their beat, topics to dive into and ones to stay away from. If you can connect the dots, those notes from an initial call start to feed into the 1 pagers for future calls.</p>

<h3>Onto the briefing</h3>

<p>Of course it&rsquo;s important to land the briefing in the first place, but just as important is getting it right. Coming into it, the reporter will have already gotten the high level pitch&hellip; It&rsquo;s why they took the call. You&rsquo;ll get a mixed bag of those that are open to teeing up the opportunity to those that want to get right to the news. Roll with what they prefer, but also don&rsquo;t be afraid of trying to hit some of your key points.</p>

<h4>Have your key messages ready</h4>

<p>Sound bites help hugely here. Analogies, customer references, whatever you want to hit. Have it ready. Also if you&rsquo;ve got a great sound bite that helps tell the story, it can make the reporter&rsquo;s job easier. Just don&rsquo;t swing too far into happy go lucky marketing land. It’s important to remember that you’re talking to a person. Have a conversation &ndash; don’t talk at them.</p>

<h4>Go slow</h4>

<p>It may seem obvious when you think about it, but as you&rsquo;re talking the reporter is writing. Or at least you hope they are. Some do it by hand and type up notes late, some type right then and there. When you hear a pause it doesn&rsquo;t always mean to keep going and it seldom means hurry up. Become extra comfortable with pauses. Check in if you&rsquo;re going to fast, if they&rsquo;re following, if they have any questions. I&rsquo;ve had people bring me in a beer before because I&rsquo;d had multiple cups of coffee through a few pitches, and they were trying to slow me down a bit. Know your pace, and then slow it down.</p>

<h4>Questions</h4>

<p>It&rsquo;s okay if they don&rsquo;t have a lot of questions, they may not. They may have none at all. Yes, pause, and give them a chance, or even ask if they have any. But don&rsquo;t stress too much if they have no questions.</p>

<p>On the flip side of that &ndash; you’re PR person should have prepared a list of questions for you beforehand that the reporter could possibly throw your way. Be sure you’ve thought through and practiced all the Q&amp;A scenarios before the interview so you aren’t caught off-guard when you’re in front of the reporter.</p>

<h3>In conclusion</h3>

<p>If it&rsquo;s your first go around, don&rsquo;t stress too much. Have the headlines you want in your mind and key messages, or better yet write them out. <em>Personally I write key things on a whiteboard nice and large before I&rsquo;m on the call</em>. Finally once you&rsquo;re all done, enjoy reading the coverage. <strong>But you&rsquo;re not all done</strong> after you get some coverage look back, run a retrospective just like you would for a software project. What worked well, why did or didn&rsquo;t something work. What can you improve next time.</p>

<p>*Full disclosure, this is based across interactions with a small sample size of different PR agencies and individuals. Mileage may differ heavily from PR firm to PR firm, but hopefully the above provides at least some roadmap for more clarity vs. flying blind.

    <link href="http://www.craigkerstiens.com/2012/01/23/securing-your-organization/"/>
    <updated>2012-01-23T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.craigkerstiens.com/2012/01/23/securing-your-organization</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve recently been amazed at the number of companies that are still using a VPN or other means to manage their apps/network. Not just large enterprisey companies, but small agile startups. I fully understand that it works, but 95% of these places are also using another key tool for access inside their company&hellip; <em>Google Apps</em>. I fully expect companies to use google apps, its more of the former that surprises me most. For a long time OpenID wasn&rsquo;t at a usable point, even today it still isn&rsquo;t without its faults. However, it does make for a much cleaner workflow once in place than having your users login to something with they&rsquo;re used to using elsewhere.</p>

<p>In our personal lives we use email as our keys to the kingdom. In fact I now almost refuse to sign up for any service that doesn&rsquo;t let me use oauth, so why should a work place be much different. So I inquired with a few companies to see if they were fine with securing things like documentation or wiki&rsquo;s being google auth, they indeed were. Yet they still seem to have users keep one more username and password for their VPN to be able to login to access internal docs/tools.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Most tech centric companies grow their own apps for many things they do within a company. Even the heavier adopters of SaaS still end up building a lot of internal systems. So why not secure them with your email domain just as you commonly would if it were a public service?</p>

<p>The problem comes in that OpenId with google has an initial setup overhead, but after that works unbelievably well.</p>

<h2>The catch</h2>

<p>In some cases you currently have to identify your domain as an OpenId provider. This means that @yourname.com is an OpenId provider. This simply means creating a url route for openid in your base site similar to the below:</p>

<p>``` xml <a href="http://heroku.com/openid">http://heroku.com/openid</a>
&lt;?xml version=&ldquo;1.0&rdquo; encoding=&ldquo;UTF-8&rdquo;?>
&lt;xrds:XRDS xmlns:xrds=&ldquo;xri://$xrds&rdquo; xmlns=&ldquo;xri://$xrd<em>($v</em>2.0)&rdquo;>
  <XRD></p>

<pre><code>&lt;Service priority="0"&gt;
  &lt;Type&gt;http://specs.openid.net/auth/2.0/signon&lt;/Type&gt;
  &lt;URI&gt;https://www.google.com/a/craigkerstiens.com/o8/ud?be=o8&lt;/URI&gt;
&lt;/Service&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>  </XRD>
&lt;/xrds:XRDS>
```</p>

<p><em>This is due to an issue of OpenID discovery which you can read more on at: <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/google-federated-login-api/browse_thread/thread/4a7dd2312a47a082/9285cec18a30b9d3?lnk=gst&amp;q=apps+discovery&amp;pli=1#9285cec18a30b9d3.">https://groups.google.com/group/google-federated-login-api/browse_thread/thread/4a7dd2312a47a082/9285cec18a30b9d3?lnk=gst&amp;q=apps+discovery&amp;pli=1#9285cec18a30b9d3.</a> In short, setting up the above can save you a lot of time</em></p>

<h2>Setting up in apps</h2>

<p>Most web frameworks have libraries that make it easy to secure your apps with openid/oauth. In particular Django and Rails both make this pretty easy. To make this even simpler for you below is code to actually secure an internal app for both Django and Rails. You can do similar with Flask or Sinatra as well.</p>

<h3>Rails</h3>

<p>In case your admin controller isn&rsquo;t already generated:</p>

<p><code>
rails g controller admin/users
</code></p>

<p>Then anything you want to secure:</p>

<p>```
module Admin
  class UsersController &lt; ApplicationController</p>

<pre><code>before_filter :admin_required

def index
  render :text =&gt; 'Hello from the admin panel!'
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<h3>Django</h3>

<p>Finally sync your database:</p>

<p><code>
python yourapp/manage.py syncdb
</code></p>

<p>Secure any view with the <code>login_required</code> decorator as your typically would with Django.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In short with some very basic app setup you can have an internal workflow thats just as good as what you use in your day to day outside the office.</p>

    <link href="http://www.craigkerstiens.com/2011/12/02/how-heroku-works-hiring/"/>
    <updated>2011-12-02T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.craigkerstiens.com/2011/12/02/how-heroku-works-hiring</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I alluded in earlier posts of <a href="http://www.craigkerstiens.com/2011/11/02/how-heroku-works-teams-tools/">How Heroku Works</a> that we have talented engineers. In fact I would venture to say that there is not a weak link when it comes to our engineers at Heroku. Ensuring we have talented engineers makes it easier for us to find other talented engineers and maintains a level of quality in our product. This means we must be very careful about not diluting our pool of engineering talent, which is where our hiring process becomes especially key. By the time we hire a new employee, we know without a doubt they&rsquo;re a fit within our organization.</p>

<p><em>Our goal in hiring is seldom to fill a role, but more commonly to find more talented people share our goal (changing the world for developers).</em></p>

<!--more-->


<p>So what&rsquo;s our hiring process look like&hellip;.</p>

<ol>
<li><del>Review Resume/Github Profile</del></li>
<li><del>Initial Screen</del></li>
<li><del>Second Screen</del></li>
<li><del>Starter Project</del></li>
</ol>


<p>While there&rsquo;s definitely a process that we follow that&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s interesting. We way too often get worried about the steps 1, 2, 3&hellip; Instead you should focus on what&rsquo;s important: are they a fit? Can they get shit done? Who cares about how many phone screens someone goes through?! Five phone screens instead of two doesn&rsquo;t make them a better fit for your company. The short of it is they go through enough screens that you feel comfortable and you progress them through the process. For us at any point in the process if someone is determined to not be a fit the process ends there. If the process does end the hiring manager will relay this in the appropriate form, though always in writing via email as well.</p>

<p>The hiring manager could debatably be the biggest difference between our process and others. When a candidate applies to a position it goes to the hiring manager (<em>not an HR person</em>). The hiring manager will be your manager once at Heroku it&rsquo;s one in the same and this ensures from the start of the process the candidate and the manager mesh well. Yes, having the manager of a group review github profiles and resumes is extra effort, but who better to judge from a quick glance than engineers. In general as a manager you&rsquo;re evaluated on the success of those you manage, as such you should be invested heavily in those you hire. In addition to this we find a big difference in the on boarding process and how quickly someone can succeed. We have used many approaches, but the success of someone at Heroku based on having their hiring manager and manager be the same individual is best highlighted below:</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/462y1J3G0L3q1f3v1o1U/hiring-1.png" alt="Hiring Manager = Manager" /></p>

<p>While every step in the hiring process is valuable starter projects may be the most valuable to ensuring quality. The final step with nearly everyone we hire is to invite them to come hack with us. Instead of parading someone around for a day long interview we get down to business and write some code. It could be something internal to Heroku, it could be an open source project we use, it could be something interesting that the candidate feels would add value to Heroku. Starter Projects vary slightly between each hiring manager.</p>

<p>Several of our managers prefer to lay out several potential interesting projects, talk through them with the candidate, and then let the candidate decide what they&rsquo;d like to work on. Sometimes there&rsquo;s a pressing need that the candidate can jump right in and add some value. It&rsquo;s <strong>always</strong> important that the starter project is achievable, if it&rsquo;s too broad of difficult for a 1-2 day period then the manager has failed in the hiring process. Regardless of the project it&rsquo;s far more than an exercise on a white board, it&rsquo;s actually what life is like at Heroku. We have lunch at the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teich/4928103311/">same table</a> that we eat at every other day, we interact just as we normally would, and after work there may or may not <a href="http://drunken-samurai-42.tumblr.com/">be drinks</a> just like any other day.</p>

<p><em>As a slight aside, we even conduct starter projects when current Herokai move from one team to another</em></p>

<p>Starter projects usually last anywhere from a day to several days. At the end of a starter project the candidate presents what they did, in a similar fashion to weekly demos that occur at workshop (more on that some other time). In earlier days it was nearly the entire company that would sit in, ask questions and give feedback. Now it&rsquo;s a bit harder for all us to fit into one conference room, though there&rsquo;s an open invite and anyone that wishes can sit in (often 10-20 Herokai). At the end of the starter project there&rsquo;s no question that the candidate fits or doesn&rsquo;t, often from both sides. Of course if it&rsquo;s a fit we make an offer and welcome them into the family.</p>

    <link href="http://www.craigkerstiens.com/2011/11/07/how-heroku-works-maker-day/"/>
    <updated>2011-11-07T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.craigkerstiens.com/2011/11/07/how-heroku-works-maker-day</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my earlier post on <a href="/2011/11/02/how-heroku-works-teams-tools/">Teams and Tools at Heroku</a>, I mentioned how we value engineers' time; their work has enabled us to build a great platform. As a result of what we&rsquo;ve built, we&rsquo;ve had great growth both of our platform and of our teams internally. With that growth inevitably comes different distractions on engineers' time. Despite how a manager may plan things, engineering work needs long periods of uninterrupted time. To ensure that no matter what, an engineer has plenty of opportunity to do the work he or she was hired to do, Heroku has Maker&rsquo;s Day.</p>

<!--more-->


<p><em>Maker&rsquo;s Day ensures that engineers get a full day of uninterrupted time to focus on making things.</em></p>

<p><img src="/images/makerday.png" alt="Maker's Day" /></p>

<p>The more consistent interruptions are throughout an engineer&rsquo;s day, the more time will be lost due to context switching in addition to the time spent on those other activities. These interruptions may include a quick question from a manager, a question on a code problem someone else is working through, or an email or IM from a coworker. Regardless of the type of interruption, it causes an engineer to lose focus. According to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0932633439/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mypred-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0932633439">Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams</a>, in a study regarding productivity among engineers, the top performers when surveyed said they were interrupted regularly 38% of the time versus the bottom performers, who were interrupted 76%. Context switching should be counted as fully wasted time for an engineer, and all too often as the number of meetings increases, the time involved with context switching is increased similarly to the following:</p>

<p><img src="/images/contextswitch.png" alt="Cost of context switching" /></p>

<p>For more on how interruptions or context switching decreases productivity, Jeff Atwood has a great post about <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/09/the-multi-tasking-myth.html">The Multi-Tasking Myth</a>, which demonstrates &hellip;</p>

<p>Most people understand that context switching is bad, but another team may still have valid demands on your time. Pushing back against another team or manager isn&rsquo;t always feasible; after all, we do work together, and each team at times may need something from another team. This is where Maker&rsquo;s Day starts to come in. Every Thursday at Heroku is Maker&rsquo;s Day.</p>

<p><strong>Maker&rsquo;s day is meant for making shit. Meetings don&rsquo;t happen on Maker&rsquo;s Day</strong>. If someone asks if that time on your calendar works for a meeting, the simple response is no&mdash;it&rsquo;s Maker&rsquo;s Day. Because Maker&rsquo;s Day has been ingrained into our culture, engineers have no problem giving that response when there&rsquo;s a request on their time on Maker&rsquo;s Day. If someone in marketing, sales, or another non-engineering role wants to book meetings, they’re welcome to do so, but they&rsquo;re going to be without engineers. However, even for non-engineers, Maker&rsquo;s Day is equally invaluable; uninterrupted hours of focus at a time are amazing for productivity in any role.</p>

<p>Maker&rsquo;s Day varies in how it is executed from person to person. Often the office is slightly less busy due to some engineers working from home or coffee shops to maximize their productivity. To an outsider, the office may appear business as usual: engineers sit at their desks, working. At lunch, everyone is sitting around the lunch table eating together. To the unobservant eye it may appear to be just any other day, but the engineers notice the difference. There will be significantly less interruptions by someone walking over to your desk, you won&rsquo;t be pulled into meetings that distract you from features, and you know it&rsquo;s an opportunity to accomplish a bulk of work laid out from your weekly planning meeting.</p>

<p>As Heroku has grown, meetings have increased, and the value of Maker Day&rsquo;s has increased exponentially.</p>

<p>Whether you&rsquo;re in the early stages of bootstrapping a company or at a large company of thousands of engineers, one of the best practices anyone can put into place is dedicated quality time for engineers to produce code. Maker&rsquo;s Day is a fantastic way to ensure this happens on a weekly basis.</p>

    <link href="http://www.craigkerstiens.com/2011/11/06/how-heroku-works-dashboards/"/>
    <updated>2011-11-06T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.craigkerstiens.com/2011/11/06/how-heroku-works-dashboards</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Commonly these broader metrics are constantly visible. Heroku takes an approach that if a dashboard is visible and something looks bad its likely to get asked about and fixed. These aren&rsquo;t executive level dashboards about user count and revenue, instead its engineering focused like so much else of Heroku.</p>

<p>Because we love building a product for engineers, displayed publicly are the metrics engineers care about. Near the lunch table you&rsquo;ll find a persistent TV with average response time per request, tests that are passing, and requests per second across the platform.</p>

<p>Additionally individual dashboards exist on a per team basis. For example in The Vault (Heroku&rsquo;s payments and billings team), you&rsquo;ll find a screen constantly displaying recent test results and a quick view of percentages in the top right that relate to success versus failures for certain metrics.</p>
