Over the past year I've acquired a variety of connected devices that are located throughout my house or on me. Many of these at the time were cool geek toys with the promise of being awesome, more recently I've started to actually connect these to make many details as automated as possible. The result thus far has been extremely positive, but not without its steps in learning, and as I normally do here's a post with some of the why, what, and how I've gone about configuring things. 

### The devices

* [Phillips Hue Starter Kit](http://www.amazon.com/Philips-431643-Personal-Wireless-Frustration/dp/B00BSN8DN4)
* [3 Phillips Hue LightStrips](http://store.apple.com/us/product/HD231VC/A/philips-friends-of-hue-lightstrips)
* [Sonos Play 3](http://www.amazon.com/SONOS-Wireless-Speaker-Streaming-Music/dp/B005441AJC/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1394678097&sr=1-1-catcorr&keywords=sonos+play+3)
* [Synology]()
* [Pebble](http://www.amazon.com/Pebble-Smartwatch-iPhone-Android-Black/dp/B00BKEQBI0/)

### Welcome home

The first thing I wanted was to not have to touch a light when I arrived home. There's been a variety of ways to do this over the past year or so, most of them involved [ifttt](http://www.ifttt.com). And for a while many of them where fairly complicated to setup with weird find my friends configuration. A big part of what made all of my recent automation possible was the [ifttt iphone app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ifttt/id660944635?mt=8) which makes location based activities much easier. Simmply download the app, then activate the [location channel](https://ifttt.com/ios_location). 

Once you've down that having your lights come on when you arrive home is as simple as activating [the Recipe](https://ifttt.com/recipes/133781-come-home-and-your-phillips-hue-lights-turn-on-using-your-location).

### Welcomer home

So this was nice, I arrive home and lights are already on. But 90% of the time the first thing I'd do is pull out my phone, wait for it to be connected to wifi, pull up the sonos app, then finally start something playing. Why couldn't I simply be welcomed home to this experience. And so I set off, first thinking well maybe there's a nice simple recipe. I searched and found [this great little thing](https://ifttt.com/recipes/151214-play-sonos-when-arriving-home), which at first was largely useless. 

### Setting the mood

One thing I'd had l
