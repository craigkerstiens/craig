Commonly these broader metrics are constantly visible. Heroku takes an approach that if a dashboard is visible and something looks bad its likely to get asked about and fixed. These aren't executive level dashboards about user count and revenue, instead its engineering focused like so much else of Heroku. 

Because we love building a product for engineers, displayed publicly are the metrics engineers care about. Near the lunch table you'll find a persistent TV with average response time per request, tests that are passing, and requests per second across the platform. 

Additionally individual dashboards exist on a per team basis. For example in The Vault (Heroku's payments and billings team), you'll find a screen constantly displaying recent test results and a quick view of percentages in the top right that relate to success versus failures for certain metrics.
