Heroku has been growing rapidly lately, both in terms of our user base as well as our teams that help make Heroku great. With this growth there's an increasing demand on individuals' time to interview candidates, ramp up new hires, collaborate cross organization... in short, individuals are putting in more time on procedural things. Many of those items, while very valuable, start to conflict with actually producing the code which at the end of the day is what we want engineers doing. As a result most teams at Heroku observe Maker Day.

Maker day is, simply put, for making things. Engineers writing code, UX and designers designing, product managers engaging with customers or defining product needs--in general each person does their job to improve the platform. Our goal at Heroku is to never encumber employees with so many meetings their unable to be productive (though even short meetings and buckets of productive time are a partial step towards optimizing engineers productivity). Engineering is a task that requires truly focused time and effort. On a common day a schedule may look something like this:

* 9:00 - arrive at the office
* 10:30 - team standup
* 11:00 - meeting cross team
* 12:30 - lunch
* 1:00 - all hands meeting
* 2:30 - meeting with another team
* 4:00 - interview candidate
* 5:00 - feedback on candidate
* 5:15 - meeting on product feature
* 6:30 - depart from office

If you'll notice there are 4-5 one hour slots throughout the day for an engineer to be productive. 

*On maker day the common schedule looks a little more like this:*

* 9:00 - arrive at the office
* 10:30 - team standup
* *ENGINEERING*
* 12:30 - lunch
* *ENGINEERING*
* 6:30 - depart from office

Outside of a short 15 minute stand up, 

Maker day ensures that on an organization-wide level, engineers get to do what they came to Heroku to do, which is to write great code and build an awesome platform. Even product managers and marketing people have plenty of things on their to-do list that don't involve meetings. Perhaps there are interesting questions you've been hoping to answer, or a customer survey you'd like to get sent out.
