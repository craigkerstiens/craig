We've talked some about <a href="http://craigekerstiens.com/2011/02/14/bootstrappedstartup-marketing-part-1/">SEO</a>, <a href="http://craigekerstiens.com/2011/02/16/bootstrappedstartup-marketing-part-2/">media/blog posts</a>, adwords, no one of these is a magic bullet. Some work better for different reasons. As I mentioned in the first post, if you haven't checked out the post on <a href="http://craigekerstiens.com/2011/02/03/tactical-steps-for-startup-metrics/">tactically measuring metrics</a> then please do. If you have followed those steps and explore each of these options, then you should have an idea of which one works well for you and which doesn't. The final piece of marketing may be a bit harder to measure, but is going to do great things towards growing your brand to users and visitors.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Retargetting</span></strong>
Retargetting is the idea of showing an ad to a user that has already visited your site. It's pretty basic, someone comes to your site and you have a pixel that loads telling your ad network they've visited. From then on they may see your ad when randomly browsing the web. With my most recent venture into the online registry space I was browsing Chiacgo Tribune and Slashdot and came across our ads. There's absolutely no contextual relevance there, but I checked and it was due to our retargetting. This will make it appear as if you are everywhere to your users. If you do want to heavily monitor what retargetting is doing for you, the best place to do it is around your retention metric.

How do you do retargetting? Sounds like a complicated process slightly... Well it's simple you don't, let one of the major ad networks do it for you. The first step for it, is to use image ads. Text based ads may work great for google and facebook, but on most of the websites your retargetting will run on you want to have images that the blogs typically serve. The 3 key form factors you'll want are:
<ul>
	<li>300x250</li>
	<li>728x90</li>
	<li>160x600</li>
</ul>
As for who to use for a service? Google recently launched their service in the past year and called it ReMarketing. I've had mixed results with google with regards to their approval process on images. Many times I've had images sit in a queue for a full month, then finally reached out to their support and have it take another 3 days. For this reason alone, it almost makes it worthwhile to go with the better customer service. I've used <a href="http://www.adroll.com">AdRoll</a> for basic ad campaigns as well as ReTargetting. I must say I absolutely love them for ReTargetting. For standard ad campaigns they do a good amount to optimize performance, but you are also paying a premium for it. Those are the two I'm most aware of, but if others know of great retargetting services I'd love to hear about them and give them a try.

If you want your shop to seem like a mom and pop site that has 100 visitors a month, then retargetting will hold absolutely no value for you. But even if you do only have 100 visitors a month, with retargetting they'll get some confidence that you're a real online brand with a presence.
