I head up the Cloud team at [@citusdata](https://www.citusdata.com). Citus extends Postgres to be a horizontally scalable distributed database. If you have a database, especially Postgres, that needs to scale beyond a single node (typically at 100GB and up) would love to chat with you to see if we can help.

Previously I spent a number of years @heroku, a Platform-as-a-service, which takes much of the overhead out of IT from keeping the lights on and lets developers focus on building features and adding value. The bulk of my time at Heroku I spent running product and marketing for [Heroku Data](https://www.heroku.com/postgres). 

I'm originally from the South, specifically Alabama, but am fairly close to a local of the Bay area being here over 7 years now. If you're San Francisco Bay Area so if you're around and want to chat about Product stuff, Heroku, [Wine](/about/wine.html), [Football](http://www.rolltide.com/sports/m-footbl/) or other things in general feel free to reach out to me [@craigkerstiens](http://www.twitter.com/craigkerstiens). 

In addition to writing about tech, startups, databases on here I:

* Curate [Postgres Weekly](http://www.postgresweekly.com), a weekly email newsletter with Postgres content 
* [Speak at quite a few conferences](/about/speaking.html), if you're interested in having me talk at one reach out
* [Speak many words of wisdom on twitter like everyone else](http://www.twitter.com/craigkerstiens)

If you want help with optimizing your DB for performance or getting insights into your data please reach out [craig.kerstiens@gmail.com](mailto:craig.kerstiens@gmail.com)
