I'm part of the team [@heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a Platform-as-a-service, which takes much of the overhead out of IT from keeping the lights on and lets developers focus on building features and adding value. Specifically I work with the [Heroku Data](https://www.heroku.com/postgres) team focused on defining what a Cloud Database service should look like and working to build such a service. I'm originally from the South, specifically Alabama, but am fairly close to a local of the Bay area being here over 7 years now. If you're San Francisco Bay Area so if you're around and want to chat about Product stuff, Heroku, [Wine](/about/wine.html), [Football](http://www.rolltide.com/sports/m-footbl/) or other things in general feel free to reach out to me [@craigkerstiens](http://www.twitter.com/craigkerstiens). 

In addition to writing about tech, startups, databases on here I:

* Curate [Postgres Weekly](http://www.postgresweekly.com), a weekly email newsletter with Postgres content 
* [Speak at quite a few conferences](/about/speaking.html), if you're interested in having me talk at one reach out
* [Speak many words of wisdom on twitter like everyone else](http://www.twitter.com/craigkerstiens)
