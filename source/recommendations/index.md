Some personal favorites of services/products that I couldn't imagine living without now.

## Products

* [Kyocera Ceramic Knife](http://www.amazon.com/Kyocera-Revolution-Series-Paring-Santoku/dp/B000KU7I50?ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=mypred-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0932633439) - Absolute favorite and best knife I've ever used in a kitchen
* [Synology](http://www.amazon.com/Synology-DiskStation-Diskless-Network-Attached/dp/B005YW7OLM/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1366124416&sr=1-1&keywords=synology+ds212j) - Great simple NAS that just works. Supports 2 disks, though they have larger ones as well.
* [Sonos](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005441AJC?tag=mypred-20) - Wireless speakers that quite simply just work. Also pretty solid sound quality
* [Double hinged corkscrew](https://www.amazon.com/Waiters-Corkscrew-HiCoup-All-one/dp/B00MSXW15E/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&qid=1494169125&sr=8-9&keywords=double+hinged+corkscrew+waiter&tag=mypred-20) - As wine is pretty much a hobby, I've tried a lot of corkscrews, electric, rabbits, etc. This one still blows them all away.

## Services
